The exciting battle for promotion between Luke Petros’ WhaWha and Tendai Chikuni’s ZPC Munyati took a twist this weekend after the former suffered a shock defeat to the Joel Luphahla-coached TelOne. BY TERRY MADYAUTA ZPC Munyati edged Blanket Mine 1-0 to climb to the summit of the Central Region Division One Soccer League (PSL). The power utility side moved to 27 points while WhaWha remained on 25 and their defeat also opened up a window of opportunity for Tongogara and Sheasham. Tongogara are third on the log with 25 points although with an inferior goal difference to WhaWha while Sheasham and MSU are both tied on 23 points. The prison wardens host log leaders ZPC Munyati in their next match, where they will be looking to restore their advantage. However, Petros is confident that his side will grab the solitary slot into the Premier Soccer League. “We are fighting for the championship and despite the TelOne setback, we are going to win this slot and make a return to the prestigious league. “We lost to TelOne, but we will correct our mistakes when we host ZPC Munyati on Saturday which is an advantage to us because we will be at home. “You win some and lose some, but we hope to quickly bounce back and make sure we regain control,” he said. After accounting for the scalp of WhaWha, Lupahla is confident that he will lead TelOne into the PSL. “We are happy that we are managing to prove our worthy in the league. The race is still open and we are doing everything to achieve our end of season goals. “We just want to avoid losing and consolidate our position and we cannot afford to drop points at this stage because we don’t want the gap between us and the leading pack to increase,” he said.
