UMKHATHI Theatre Works is set to present a new African dance show, Bloom Bloom, celebrating the arrival of the spring season at this year’s edition of the Intwasa Arts Festival. BY SHARON SIBINDI Umkhathi Theatre Works founder Matesu Dube confirmed the developments to NewsDay Life & Style. “This was regarded as the start of a new year in Africa and many celebrations took place during this time of the year.
Everyone is happy, the trees are happy, the forest is decorated with blooming flowers and new leaves and scented by the blooming flowers,” he said. He said while performing traditional dances that originate in southern Africa, the show, with a cast of 24 people, uses powerful music, drumming and traditional dance to celebrate life. Umkhathi Theatre Works, who premiered their latest historical theatre piece, Ihloka, during last year’s edition of Intwasa, said this year’s show was different and it is their first time to use a 24-member cast in the production. “Dance shows have an impact when you have a big cast, that is when the artistry of choreography is visible as compared to a small cast,” he said. Dube said plans were afoot for the production to run in Bulawayo in December. “We have plans to run Bloom Bloom again in the City of Bulawayo in the month of December so that those who will miss the Intwasa show will have a chance to watch the show during the December holidays,” he said. “Through this show, we would like to showcase the beauty of African traditional dance and also preserve the dances.” He, however, said the country had few opportunities for theatre practitioners as the economy has not been functional for many years, negatively impacting the arts industry.
