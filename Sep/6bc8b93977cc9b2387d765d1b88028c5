Warrior’s midfielder Kudakwashe Mahachi is confident that they will collect maximum points in this weekend’s Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) qualifier against Congo Brazzaville on Sunday. BY GARISH PHIRI The squad closed off their home preparations with an afternoon training session at the National Sports Stadium yesterday and is expected to leave today. Mahachi has been in good form for his club, the Soweto giants Orlando Pirates this season, and the Warriors technical team, led by Sunday Chidzambga, will be hoping that he carries on in similar vein for the national team. The 24-year-old said that the fact that Congo lost their first match against the Democratic Republic of Congo meant that they would be tough to beat in their home conditions. “It’s a tough game for us because in their last game, they lost to DRC and we won against Liberia. We need to keep our cool, listen to what the coaches say and I think we are going to come with a good result,” he said. “There is pressure obviously because we are the team that last went to Afcon finals. We are no longer a small team and that has invited a bit of pressure, but we have to keep our heads cool and focus on our game plan.” Mahachi assured fans that the team would not let them down in Congo. “Fans must support us and we are not going to disappoint. It’s going to be tough, but we are going to fight for the nation,” he said. On the other hand, striker Knox Mutizwa, who has also enjoyed a good run of form for South Africa’s Golden Arrows, hopes he can do just as well for the Warriors if he gets an opportunity on Sunday. “So far so good, I am one of the players that has been performing well in the Absa Premier League. I think I should work hard so that I get selected into the team and I hope to score. We have been preparing very well and we are ready,” he said. Zimbabwe will be looking to at least avoid a defeat in Congo to enhance their chances of making it to the finals in Cameroon.
