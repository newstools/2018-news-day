Sport and Recreation Committee (SRC) acting director-general Joseph Muchechetere yesterday appeared in court facing charges of misusing more than $2 million he received from sponsors. BY DESMOND CHINGARANDE Muchechetere (48) was not asked to plead when he appeared before Harare magistrate Rumbidzai Mugwagwa facing two counts of criminal abuse of office and was remanded to October 11 on $100 bail. The complainant is the Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation ministry’s permanent secretary Prince Mupazviriwo. It is the State’s case that on February 7, 2008, SRC, represented by Muchechetere, entered into a tripartite co-operation agreement with funders namely, Norwegian Olympic and Paralympic Committee and Confederation of Sports, United Nations Children’s Fund for Community Sport Development and Youth Education through Sport in Zimbabwe. The State alleges during the same period, the Community Sport Development Programme department was formed within the SRC to oversee the implementation of the project. During the period extending from 2009 to 2015, Muchechetere allegedly caused the opening of two separate accounts at Stanbic Bank, where the donated funds were banked. He allegedly went on to manage and approve the finances outside the normal system of SRC finance department. The court heard that Muchechetere, through these bank accounts, received a total amount of $2 132 284 from the funders. He was also accused of refusing to implement the SRC board resolution to dissolve Zimbabwe Football Association board which was led by Cuthbert Dube and appoint an interim board as mandated by the Sports and Recreation Act, thereby favouring Dube. Sebastian Mutizirwa appeared for the State.
