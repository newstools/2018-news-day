Ngezi Platinum coach Tonderai Ndiraya was ecstatic and said it was all about the end result, as his team did not play particularly well. “Three points, I am happy and I think that is what is important. Of course, we were not really ourselves today. We didn’t play really well, but I am pleased with the fight, determination and commitment put in by the boys today for us to get three points,” he said. “I guess what is important is getting three points at this stage of the season and I am pleased we managed it.” Ndiraya added that he was pleased they had cut the gap with the leaders. ZPC Kariba gaffer Godfrey Tamirepi bemoaned his team’s lack of composure, as they gave too much respect to their opponents. “It’s a frustrating defeat. We came in the first half and we gave a lot of respect to a team that was playing long balls and nothing else,” he said. In the 26th minute, Ngezi could have taken the lead, but Sylvester Appiah’s challenge denied Charamba. In the 73rd minute, substitute Moses Demera had a glorious opportunity to level matters for the visiting side, as he tried a dink over Benard Donovan, who was off his mark, but his attempt was weak.
