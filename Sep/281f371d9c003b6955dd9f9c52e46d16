GOSPEL songbird Janet Manyowa has collaborated with United States-based veteran musician Shingisai Suluma on a single titled Muchengeti set for release next Friday. BY ANESU MUSHAWATU Speaking through her manager-cum-husband Munyaradzi Manyowa, the musician told NewsDay Life & Style that the single was inspired by Psalms 121:5-6. “Muchengeti … is about remembering that God is the keeper of our hearts and we should always trust in Him in every thought, action and plan,” she said. “It entails how we should always rely on Him in our daily Christian walk, remembering that He never sleeps.” Manyowa said working with Suluma was an amazing, yet humbling experience. “Mai Suluma is a great songwriter and musician. Working with her was a fun, but eye-opening experience. We learnt a lot from her through this collaboration. I have so much respect for her.” Manyowa has been topping charts with her recent single titled Tinomutenda Nei? which was launched during the second edition of her Worship Moments Concert in Harare. She said the single had ministered to many people as evidenced by the several testimonies she has received. Suluma, who relocated to the US to take up a post as a United Nations Children’s Fund (Unicef) goodwill ambassador several years ago, told NewsDay Life & Style earlier this year that her decision to relocate had not affected her music, but had enriched her skills and provided her opportunities to share her talent with non-African
artistes. She said she had been following the current local gospel trends and was proud of emerging gospel artistes, including Manyowa.
