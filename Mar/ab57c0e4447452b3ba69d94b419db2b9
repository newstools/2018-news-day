ACADEMIC books publisher Global Institute of Business has appealed to the government over the high cost of evaluation and retention of books by the Curriculum Development Unit. BY TAFADZWA KACHIKO The company’s representative, Danai Mazongonda, made the appeal at the National Youth Consultative Forum for the northern region hosted by the Women and Youths Affairs ministry last week. “We are appealing to the government to look into book evaluation fees charged at the Curriculum Development Unit, so that we can have our books evaluated. We are charged $1 per page plus 25% retention fee, which depends on the number of pages a book has,” he said. “We have about seven titles, but it’s like getting penalised for being creative or developing material for the new curriculum. This is too prohibitive, especially for young entrepreneurs. We need to be given a special facility to evaluate now and pay later.” Some of the books by the organisation are A Level Pure Mathematics Theory Practice Nexus, A Level Statistics and Mechanics Theory Practice Nexus, A Level Pure Mathematics, Statistics and Mechanics Theory Practice Nexus, Chemistry Redefined O Level Chemistry, Physics Redefined O Level Physics and O Level Business Enterprise Skills. Meanwhile, Epilepsy in Arts founder and director, Tinei Mavhunga asked government to provide books on first aid to people with epilepsy seizures to deal with other emergencies. “Many people run away when one is caught with epileptic seizure, a clear indication of the lack of understanding of the condition and the know-how on how to give first aid to the victims,” he said. “Although cases of epilepsy are around 2% there is still need to consider having books in schools teaching about giving first aid to such people in times of emergency and other emergencies.” Women and Youth Affairs minister Sithembiso Nyoni said her ministry would address all issues raised by the youth during the consultative forum.
