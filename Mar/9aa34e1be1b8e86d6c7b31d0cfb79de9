AFTER years of mesmerising people on the stage, songbird Pah Chihera has taken her artistry to another level, spreading her wings into film acting after she landed a role in a forthcoming movie, Gehena Harina Moto. BY WINSTONE ANTONIO In the movie, Pah Chihera features as Mai Tambu, the third wife who is loyal to her polygamist husband and loved by her community, while she is hated by the other two wives. Pah Chihera will join the long list of local musicians who have explored their acting talents as they featured in films who include Oliver Mtukudzi, Kudzai Sevenzo, Prudence Katomeni-Mbofana and Jah Prayzah. In an interview with NewsDay Life & Style yesterday, the Runonzi Rudo hitmaker said she accepted the role to show her versatility and the other side of her talents she has ignored. “Getting involved in my first production Gehena Harina Moto is a great move that provides me with the chance to show my other talent in a different genre to the fans who support me in this showbiz,” she said. “I just feel it is the right time I explore the other side of Pah Chihera as for me music and acting complement, it each other.” On the music front, Pah Chihera said she is working on singles and videos before she releases an album. Pah Chihera won hearts of the many with her Afro-contemporary sounds rich with a Zimbabwean traditional feel that has seen her collaborating with many other artistes across genres.
