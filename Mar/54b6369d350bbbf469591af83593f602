THE ninth edition of the Inkululeko Yabatsha School of Arts’ (IYASA) Isiphiwo Sami Talent Search show targeting high schools from Bulawayo metropolitan ended on Friday, with Evelyn High School coming first after beating other 40 groups in the competition. BY SHARON SIBINDI The talent search, which commenced on January 9, ran under the theme, Of Morals and Our Generation. The competition saw the 12 schools using theatre, music and dance in line with the theme. Evelyn Girls High School clinched 240 points, Gifford High School had 230 points and Emganwini High School came third with 213 points. The adjudicators said they loved the way the theme was interpreted and they appreciated the work which was done by the schools. “We appreciate the works done by the schools, which managed to take part in this year’s talent search. Some of you did not follow the notes which you were given. Do not exaggerate some of the things, you are the reflections of the society,” they said. IYASA founder, Nkululeko Dube, thanked the participants who took part in the edition and also confirmed that the competition was indeed stiff. “The ninth edition was so stiff and I would thank those who took part in this year’s edition. Isiphiwo Sami has become a calendar event and project for high schools in the region. Owing to the new curriculum, which encourages arts education I think the program has come of age,” he said. “It has developed over the years and at the 9th edition we saw a huge improvement in the standards of presentations. Schools work with professionals in the sector and that alone affords the young minds a rare opportunity to learn from the best in the industry. Next year Isiphiwo will celebrate its 10th anniversary and it promises to be even bigger and more exciting.”
