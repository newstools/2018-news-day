NOMINEES for the 2018 Zimbabwe Achievers (ZAA) South Africa have been announced, with winners set to be pronounced at a gala dinner pencilled for April 7 in Sandton, Johannesburg. BY ANESU MUSHAWATU Voting commenced yesterday following the unveiling of over 60 nominees across 14 categories including the Event of the Year award in which music superstar Oliver “Tuku” Mtukudzi and Jah Prayzah will battle for honours with Oliver Mtukudzi Live in Capetown and Jah Prayzah Live in Johannesburg. ZAA South Africa’s event director Lawrence Dube said they were happy because they have attracted significant corporate support after WorldRemit, Fastjet, Africa Medallion Group and Zimbabwe Consolidators threw in their lot with them. “We are very happy to welcome three prominent brands who have a strong business and community presence, both nationally and internationally,” Dube said in a statement. “The diverse partnerships would only reinforce an already growing relationship with the Zimbabwean community on an International scale.” Dube said tickets were selling at R650 and the comprehensive three-tier ticket campaign, introduced last year, had been implemented in response to positive feedback received about the special offer on tickets last year. The 2018 categories include Large Business of the Year, Small to Medium Business of the Year, Female Entrepreneur, Male Entrepreneur, Professional of the Year, Community Champion, Community Organisation, Academic Excellence, Media Personality, Sports Personality, Young Achiever, Music Artiste, Event of the Year and People’s Choice.
