THE 2018 edition of the Harare International Festival of the Arts (Hifa) will see a number of international comedians including Kavin Jay from Malaysia, Salvado from Uganda and South Africa’s Nqoba Ngcobo taking part in the arts and culture fête. BY WINSTONE ANTONIO Hifa is scheduled to run from May 1 to 6 at the Harare Gardens and surrounding venues under the theme We Count and top comedian Carl Joshua Ncube will co-ordinate the jamboree’s comedy programme. Ncube told NewsDay Life & Style that the satire and humour mix line-up will also see television credits including Netflix Comedy and Central DSTV Box Office. “We are bringing in Kavin Jay from Malaysia who has just done his first Netflix special, Salvado the comedy giant from Uganda who has just come from sold out shows with Basket Mouth in United Kingdom and from South Africa Nqoba Ngcobo an awesome comic as seen on Comedy Central and writes for some big TV shows,” he said. Ncube said his thrust to identify such international comedians with television credits is to build a better understanding of the distribution of comedy to international audiences. “This line up shows the variety of comedy out there. I have performed with these guys and they serve entirely different markets. Zimbabweans need to understand the vast differences in comedy and it is the objective of the festival to educate audiences while we make them laugh,” he said. Ncube said the festival will for the first time launch the Our Girls Killing It, a platform to start building an industry with female comedians, adding that he will train some new female stand-up comedians, at a workshop. Meanwhile, South Africa’s Beatenberg, a pop music band and the esteemed Afro-fusion group, Freshlyground, will also perform at Hifa 2018.
