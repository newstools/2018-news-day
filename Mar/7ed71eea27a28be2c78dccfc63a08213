Listed telecoms and tech giant, Econet Wireless Zimbabwe (EWZ), has taken the lead in the use of artificial intelligence to manage its customer services support in a move set to significantly improve its customer experience. BY BUSINESS REPORTER Artificial intelligence is the automated use of technology and machines to perform routine and complex human tasks. Econet recently launched “Bud-e”, a Chatbot — or computer software programmed to simulate human behaviour — which is designed to carry out some of its customer services support work, including assisting customers to install Internet and data settings on their devices, recover recharge keys from over-scratched recharge cards, reset EcoCash PIN requests, and carry out EcoCash transaction reversals, among other support functions. Speaking on the initiative, Econet’s chief operating officer, Fayaz King, said the service would improve the overall customer experience of Econet’s growing customer base.
“The goal is to improve our customer experience,” King said. “So we are leveraging our digital communication platforms to deploy AI to improve our customer experience and create additional channels and convenience for customers to get their queries speedily resolved,” he said, adding that the Chatbot would provide instant and precise responses to assist customers with product and service issues via Econet’s Facebook Page. King said the operator was “constantly innovating to improve our business processes and to optimise our existing assets and channels with the clear object to improve both the quality of our products and to improve the customers’ overall experience”. “As we take on more customers and offer more products and services, the need for agile and smart customer support tools will increase, as will our customers’ demand for faster and prompt support and service” he said. Econet has more than 10 million customers and has been a pacesetter in introducing innovative products on the market.
