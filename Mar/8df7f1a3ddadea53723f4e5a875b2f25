The spokesperson of Zambia’s President Edgar Lungu has dismissed a plan by the main opposition party to impeach him. BBC He said that he was confident that the motion will not be successful and described it as a continuation of the opposition’s failed court challenge of the president’s election victory. Members of Zambia’s United Party for National Development say misconduct and corruption are some of the reasons why they’re calling for Mr Lungu’s impeachment. The motion which is expected to be debated next week was submitted to parliament last night and signed by a third of lawmakers, including two former government ministers. The motion would need the backing of two-thirds of the lawmakers to succeed. President Lungu has also dismissed reports he is too ill to run the country, saying that he is well and healthy. He also said his marriage was blissful after reports that his wife was leaving him. The political atmosphere has been volatile since last year’s arrest of opposition leader Hakainde Hichilema who was in custody for four months after his convoy failed to make way for President Lungu’s motorcade last year. Treason charges against Mr Hichilema were subsequently dropped.
