ZIMBABWE College of Music (ZMC) executive director, Rachel Jera-Chigwanda has urged musicians to enrol for various music education programmes offered by the institution, which she said would help artistes to grow beyond the narrow spheres of a music career. BY WINSTONE ANTONIO Chigwanda told NewsDay Life & Style recently that they are committed to uplifting talent in line with the college’s vision. “We are happy with the positive response in terms of enrolment as more students are seeing value in our music programmes to be better artistes. It is important for musicians to enrol for different music programmes, as it helps them improve their artistic projects and careers,” she said. “Enrolling at a music school helps artistes to learn skills and grow far beyond the narrow sphere of a music career.” Meanwhile, there was entertainment galore at a music concert held at the college last week with students putting up stellar performances that left guests clamouring for more. The students performed their own compositions and some cover versions of seasoned artistes including Jah Prayzah, Winky D, Soul Jah Love, Alick Macheso and Oliver Mtukudzi. While the students proved their ability at composing music, their performances of cover versions resonated with the guests, many of whom took to the dance floor.
ZCM performance director, Terence Kwenda applauded the level of talent exhibited by the students on the night. “These students have a lot of talent that you cannot rule them out to be forces to reckon with on the local showbiz scene in few years to come. Their stage works and compositions really tells how much talented they are,” he said. Artistes, who received professional training from the college include Hifa founder and artistic director Manuel Bagorro, producer Clive “Mono” Mukundu, Hope Masike and Charles Charamba.
