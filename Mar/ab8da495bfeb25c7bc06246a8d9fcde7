LOCAL businesses have to brace for competition amid interest from foreign investors, Megafest Holdings chief executive officer Tafadzwa Matsika has said.
Speaking at the inaugural Megafest Eastern Region Business awards ceremony on Wednesday in Mutare, Matsika said competition was no longer within the province, urging companies not to only benchmark with a company in Harare or South Africa. BY KENNETH NYANGANI “The competition is now international, investors are coming with fresh ideas and injecting capital so we need to change our mindset and be counted among the best, brace yourself for a tough competition, yes you are receiving an accolade but it’s not a walk in the park you have done well,” he said. President Emmerson Mnangagwa has already indicated that Zimbabwe was open for business with other countries in a bid to resuscitate the county’s struggling economy. Manicaland Provincial Affairs minister Monica Mutsvangwa (pictured), who was the guest of honour at the awards ceremony, said that there was need to always keep the province (Manicaland) and Zimbabwe peaceful to attract investors. She, however, hailed MegaFest for honouring businesspeople and companies in the eastern region respectively. “The reason we are here is that we need to put the province on the map. I want to thank MegaFest for honouring our businesspeople in Manicaland and companies, this will give power to work hard,” he said. “President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s vision is clear that Zimbabwe is open for businessman and lets work on the vision of our President,” he said. Mutare City Council town clerk Joshua Maligwa headlined the event after winning the male manager of the year while Pamela Machakanja was the female manager of the year. Africa University vice-chancellor Munashe Furusa won the chief executive officer of the year award.
