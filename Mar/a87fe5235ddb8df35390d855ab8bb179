AFRO-TRADITIONAL Indie jazz artiste, Tendai “WaChari” Chari today marks his official entry into the music industry, with the launch of his debut album, Bumharutsva, at Ora in Helensvale, Borrowdale. BY LIFE & STYLE REPORTER The 26-year-old crooner, who is largely inspired by life and his love for music, said he was excited to be unveiling the much-awaited product. The gifted songwriter and guitarist said he hoped for the best on the new album and was ready for the big stage. “Bumharutsva is a Shona word for the first rains and I believe the album will herald a new season in my career and music life,” he said. “My lyrics talk about everyday struggles, encouragement, hope, love, morality and anything else in between.” The new album carries the tracks Bumharutsva, African Girl, Kuziva Mbuya, Mashoko, Mwana Wemusango, Ndapotsa Nda, Ndafunga Kare [Rubie], Kuremara Kwemoyo, Mhere and Andina Inzwi. WaChari also revealed that his afro-traditional indie jazz sound was a result of the artistes that inspire him, including Oliver Mtukudzi, Lokua Kanza from Congo and Dobet Gnahore from East Africa. Performing with a full-time band, Shamwari Dzerwendo, the crooner is also part of Mazwi, a band with traditional and afro-jazz fusions. A member of the Zimbabwe Business and Arts Hub (Zibah), WaChari started taking his passion for music seriously in 2013 before venturing into performance in 2014. “My first public performance was at The Slave Church for a Heritage Concert and I also played at Alive Café in Cape Town with Shamie, the other of the famed Shame and Nathan duo,” he said. Besides having performed in countries like South Africa, the gifted crooner has also performed at Pakare Paye’s Play it for Pakare with his band and at Zimbabwe-German Society.
