A DOCUMENTARY play that comically traces former President Robert Mugabe’s last moments in power, Operation Restore Regasi, is set to be restaged this Friday at Charles Austin Theatre in Masvingo, following public demand after it was oversubscribed during the first staging. BY TAFADZWA KACHIKO When the play premiered late last month at Charles Austin, the theatre was filled to the rafters, and there was demand for its restaging, according to playwright, Charles Munganasa. “We are bringing you again Operation Restore Regasi on Friday following your unanimous call. Last time, the theatre was filled to capacity, which has not been the case for a number of years,” he said. Munganasa said the play would go on a nationwide tour amid growing requests from people across the country. “Since its launch, there have been numerous calls to take it to other towns, as a way of promoting documentary theatre. We are, therefore, going to firstly tour Harare, Bulawayo, Gweru, Mutare and Victoria Falls on dates yet to be confirmed,” he said. In the play, Mike Banda plays Mugabe, with veteran actress Carol Mpofu as his wife, Grace. Munganasa plays Constantino Chiwenga, Ngoni Chinovava features as Father Fidelis Mukonori and Dereck Mapfumo as Sibusiso Moyo. Other actors are Donovan Takaendesa, Marayane Mtetwa and Farai Mukumba. Mugabe was ousted from power following a military intervention last year, having led the country for 37 years.
