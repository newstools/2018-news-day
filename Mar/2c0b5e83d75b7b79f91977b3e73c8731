THE 36 Bulawayo contestants scheduled to represent the country at the 2018 edition of the World Championships of Performing Arts (WCOPA) in the United States will hold a colour run and fundraising concert to raise $5 000. BY SHARON SIBINDI The event is scheduled for March 31 at Busters Sports Club in Bulawayo, with the entry fee pegged at $5, while rented stalls will be available at $25. The local contestants need $6 000 to take part in the championships slated for July 1 to 14 in Hollywood. One of the participants, 27-year-old model, Joanne Peters, told NewsDay Life & Style that they had decided to invite guest performers, including Cal_Vin, Rain Bow Blaze and Carlos Jiri, to headline the fundraising. “Our target is $5 000, but to make it easier for us, we need $6 000 so that we are on the safer side. From Bulawayo, alone we are 36 and we hope that money will help us,” she said. “People should come out and support us because, as performing arts in Zimbabwe, we don’t get that, especially when it comes of international performances. We do not get that much support.” Another contestant, Liam John Hall (21), said going to the championships was a breakthrough for local artists. “This is like a breakthrough for the local artistes, especially in Bulawayo. We are trying to find a way so that we can go and show that Zimbabwe has people that are very good and artistic in areas like modelling, dancing, drama and many more, since this is like a platform for us to spread our wings and show that we have the capability and we can do it,” he said.
