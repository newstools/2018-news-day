HIGH-FLYING contemporary musician Jah Prayzah on Saturday left his Gokwe fans clamouring for more after a cameo performance of six songs during the celebration of Zanu PF members from Gokwe, who were elevated to senior positions in party and
government. BY DESMOND CHINGARANDE These are Victor Matemadanda, who is now the politburo secretary for war veterans, Paul Mavima (Primary and Secondary Education minister) and Owen Ncube (Midlands Provincial Affairs minister). Jah Prayzah serenaded the over 3 000 that had gathered for the celebrations, with tracks such as Mdhara Vachauya and Kutonga Kwaro hitting high notes with the crowd. The event venue started to swell with people at around 2pm after the Mdhara Vachauya hitmaker started playing. Jah Prayzah had performed in Gokwe on previous occasions, but this was the first time to perform at a family show during the day and the youth had a chance to see their icon performing live with his band. The youth, however, said they would have wanted Jah Prayzah to have more time on stage. Other people from Gokwe town and surrounding areas including Nemangwe, Ganyungu and Njelele had arrived late, anticipating that the musician would perform until evening, but were disappointed to find event organisers dismantling the stage. The lanky musician, popularly known as Soja Rinoenda Kure, however, did not disappoint, as he put up an electrifying performance that had the thousands gathered putting on their dancing shoes.
