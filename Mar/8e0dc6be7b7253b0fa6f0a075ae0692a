Amalgamated Rural Teachers Union of Zimbabwe (ARTUZ) hails the spirit of solidarity and cooperation shown by the leading unions in the education sector organized under the banner of Federation of Zimbabwe Educators Union (FOZEU). The Federation was formed after an education sector meeting held at Zimbabwe Teachers Association offices on 10 March 2018. At the same meeting, a resolution was passed to march to the employer’s offices at Munhumutapa Buildings and petition on various issues concerning conditions of service for teachers. The four key demands raised by FOZEU are: • 100% salary increment • 75% of salary rural allowance • Restoration of vacation leave • Guarantee of safe schools before, during and after elections Addressing the leaders of the four unions who marched, ARTUZ President Obert Masaraure, be cried the paltry US$13.00 rural allowance being given to teachers each month. By contrast, top government officials award themselves hefty bush allowances averaging US$50.00 per day for visiting rural schools. “We have teachers who live at the risk of being attacked by animals when they have to go to banks. We have teacher who are out there in rural areas, giving their all because they believe that the right to education is important for all. Yet the government lack sincerity to address their issues, so we are here today to send a clear message on what we want as teachers,” he said. Other union leaders who addressed the unionists are Richard Gundane of ZIMTA, Takavafira Zhou of PTUZ, Manuel Nyawo of ZINATU and M. Furusa of PEUZ. Unions have resolved to go for strike starting opening day of the second term if their issues are not addressed and a number of coactive protest activities have been lined up during the holidays as a build up to the nationwide full strike.
