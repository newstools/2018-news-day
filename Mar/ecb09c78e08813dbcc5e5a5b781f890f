ZIMBABWE’S top junior BMX rider Benjamin Oberholzer is confident of clinching the top prize at the Interprovincial championships scheduled for Bulawayo at the weekend.
The 12 year old youngster is one of the country’s future stars with many accolades under his name already, including national champion, South African National age group champion, Africa continental Champion and Africa Challenge winner. BY FREEMAN MAKOPA “I have been training hard and will be travelling down to Durban during the school holidays for some intensive training in preparation for the world championships. “I also competed at the Gold cup in the USA and won 2 categories, and also won at Music City BMX in Nashville, “said Oberholzer. The student is having troubles in juggling school and the sport. “It has been quite hard for me to fit in training as I have started form one and combining school commitments and sports have been quite a handful. Im utilising Saturday and Sunday when im not at school for extra training.” National BMX Association of Zimbabwe will use the tournament to select the team to represent the country at this year’s inaugural BMX world championships in Baku, Azerbaijan from the June 3 -8.
