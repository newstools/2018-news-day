YOUTHFUL Bulawayo filmmaker and blogger, Nigel Ndlovu has thrown his hat into the political ring and last week announced his decision to run for the Magwegwe parliamentary seat as an independent candidate in this year’s elections. BY SINDISO DUBE Ndlovu said he was tired of complaining about the poor performance of legislators and has decided to take it upon himself to help his constituency. “I was tired of hearing people complaining, so I had to step up and participate in the election process. We, therefore, all need to rewrite our story and rebuild our Zimbabwe, but before we do all that we need to change our communities. To completely transform our communities, we need new vision and a new vision requires a new leadership,” he said. Running with the slogan, Less talk, more action, Ndlovu said he was ready to serve the people. “We need to make sure people’s voices are heard. We need solutions to our challenges and, above all, we need to unite and take action as societies. We all have a part to play. This is not about me. It’s about Magwegwe and other communities,” he said. “I am promising action, less talk. I am a servant and a tool for the people of my community to use to build and develop our beloved community.” Ndlovu holds a degree in media studies from the Zimbabwe Open University. He has worked on the 2012 National Arts Merit Awards nominated film Ivevane, Isono Sami, Freedom in 2015, Ekhaya-Home (2016) and The Way It Is and The Walk where he worked with Daniel Lasker. Ndlovu becomes the second filmmaker to announce his candidature after Rufaro Kaseke of Chitungwiza North.
