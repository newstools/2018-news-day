PRESIDENT Emmerson Mnangagwa yesterday claimed some of his ministers are struggling to cope with pressure coming from potential investors, who are “flooding” the country with many hotels in Harare fully booked. BY KENNETH NYANGANI Officially opening the $40 million Willowton Group cooking oil refinery in Mutare, Mnangagwa said the government was working towards issuing investor certificates in five hours instead of the previous six months. “Currently, since we said that Zimbabwe is open for business, Harare is flooded with investors coming from all over the world and that means that hotel space is insufficient and my ministers are kept working, no more relaxing,” he said. “My government will continue to eliminate all investment impediments, bureaucratic bottlenecks and corruption.
“I met the President of Rwanda Paul Kagame, he told me that if an investor comes to Rwanda, in six hours they will have a certificate to operate. In Zimbabwe, we pride ourselves that it takes six months, which has been reduced to 30 days. “I have now realised that we must work hard again to reduce the 30 days to five hours.” Mnangagwa said the $40 million Willowton Group investment has made a positive economic impact in Manicaland province. Willowton is one of the South African leading fast moving consumer goods manufacturers.
