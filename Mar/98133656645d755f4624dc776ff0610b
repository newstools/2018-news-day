FC PLATINUM assistant coach, Lizwe Sweswe is confident that his side are capable of retaining the Premier Soccer League title even though they are likely to play the better part of the season without head coach, Norman Mapeza, who is on a sick leave. BY TERRY MADYAUTA Mapeza, according to the club, could be out for six weeks nursing a back injury. This has left the former Tsholotsho coach, Sweswe in the spotlight, as he takes charge of a team very low on confidence having been shredded to pieces in the CAF Champions league. The Zvishavane side are seeking to salvage their pride on the domestic front by retaining the title they won last year. “We are right on track with what the head coach wants, but it’s obviously never going to be an easy task without him,” Sweswe said. “There are club objectives that need to be fulfilled and as a team, we will fight to achieve those goals. We learnt our lessons in the champions league but we will not be deterred by memories of  that experience. I am not sure how long he (Mapeza) will be out of action but in his absence, the objective is to win against any opponents we face,” he added. While there would be doubters naturally for Sweswe, he passed his first test at the helm when he guided the team in winning the Roy Mazingi memorial four team tournament played at Mandava stadium last week. The club, according to sources, have made it clear to the technical team that they expect nothing less than the league title after a disastrous CAF Champions league campaign.
