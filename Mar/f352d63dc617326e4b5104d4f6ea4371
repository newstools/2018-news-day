FALL armyworm has wreaked havoc in Chipinge, Manincaland province, where farmers are already counting their losses, as they are struggling to secure pesticides to control the outbreak. BY KENNETH NYANGANI Manicaland provincial administrator, Edgar Seenza told NewsDay recently that they had approached a local development partner, International Rescue Committee (IRC), to assist farmers with chemicals. “So far, I have information of fall armyworm in Chipinge. Farmers are having challenges to control the armyworm. One of the major issue is that they are struggling to purchase sprays to contain the armyworm,” he said “But because of challenges of relevant sprays to control the armyworm, we have discussed with one development partner in the province, the International Rescue Committee, to provide us with relevant sprays, so that we can help the farmers,” he said. “We have already toured the Mutema area with our Provincial Affairs minister Monica Mutsvangwa to assess the situation. But we realise that any further delays to provide the sprays will render the crop ineffective,” he added. Seenza said the chemicals would be distributed to the farmers though agricultural extension workers. Armyworm has been a major concern to maize farmers in Manicaland every cropping season.
