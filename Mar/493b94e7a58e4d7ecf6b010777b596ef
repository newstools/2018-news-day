Police Commissioner-General Godwin Matanga has transferred 13 police assistant commissioners to various provinces  and recalled fired Senior Assistant Commissioner Erasmus Mukodza to head the newly-created National Elections Command ahead of this year’s polls. BY Everson Mushava The transfers were announced in a leaked radio communication released on Monday. The redeployments also left the Criminal Investigation Department Law and Order without a boss, following the transfer of Assistant Commissioner Thulani Ncube to Mashonaland West where he will be the new head of crime. Assistant Commissioner Chrispen Makedenge, however, remains in Masvingo in charge of peace and security. Assistant Commissioner Grace Ndebele was moved from Harare to Matabeleland North as the head of peace and security. Senior Assistant Commissioner Mukodza, who was fired in January when the President Emmerson Mnangagwa administration cracked down on senior police cops, most of them aligned to the former President Robert Mugabe’s G40 faction before the November military intervention – bounced back as the head of a police unity dealing with elections. The National Elections Command will be tasked in ensuring that the forthcoming elections were free and fair, as to Mnangagwa’s assurance to the international community. Other assistant commissioners transferred include, Margaret Ngwenya-Gono (Mashonaland Central to Masvingo), Clever Macheka (Mashonaland West to Harare), Felistas Musvipa (Mashonaland East to Harare), Panganai Sande (national anti-stock theft to Matabeleland North),  Thulani Ncube (CID Law and Order to Mashonaland West), Edmore Mlambo (Bulawayo to CID headquarters), Dorcas Nyadenga (Harare to Midlands) Ngonidzashe Chogugudza (Midlands to Harare), among them.
