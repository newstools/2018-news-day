CONTEMPORARY musician, Jah Prayzah is set to make a return to at Hartsfield Tshisanyama in Bulawayo on April 28 after one year to quench the thirst of his huge following in the City of Kings. BY SINDISO DUBE Jah Prayzah last performed in the city at the Large City Hall in March last year. The lanky singer will be supported by Mzoe7 and Iyasa alongside wheel spinners DJ Liz, Crazy Dee, Wellyonz, Eugy and Champion sound. Jah Prayzah’s manager Keen Mushapaidze said the ever growing brand had affected Jah Prayzah’s local shows. “It’s been long since we had a show in Bulawayo and it’s all because of our international and regional engagements. Jah has been in and out of the country, making it hard to schedule local shows. The ever growing Jah Prayzah brand could have short-changed our loyal local fans, but I hope they understand,” he said. Mushapaidze said they had not snubbed their Bulawayo fans, but it was up to interested promoters to bring them to the city. Jah Prazyah will be performing his hits from runaway album Kutonga Kwaro for the first time in Bulawayo after the launch in October last year. The number of local shows Jah Prayzah has featured had been reduced due to his international engagements, which have seen him in and out of the country.
