INDOnSAKUSA, who recently dropped their 17-year-old name, Impumelelo Shining Stars, have rubbished rumours linking them to Malawian prophet, Shepherd Bushiri, who reportedly influenced them to change the group’s name. BY SINDISO DUBE This followed claims in some circles that the group was on the verge of leaving Zaoga FIF for Bushiri’s Enlightened Christian Gathering church(ECG) after their performance at FNB stadium in South Africa during a New Year cross over night for Bushiri’s church. It is alleged that the move to Bushiri’s ECG church might have influenced the group’s rebranding. However, Oscar Siziba, the group’s leader, said such claims were untrue. “Yes, we have been performing at Bushiri’s services like we do anywhere where we are invited, (but) that doesn’t mean that we are now under his church. It’s not true that we are joining or have joined his church. We are committed members of Zaoga FIF and I myself hold a leadership post in that church,” he said. “Our performances at Bushiri’s services are just the same as performing at other church gatherings, weddings and private events.” Siziba said the name change was God-inspired. “The idea is God inspired. It had been two years since God talked to us. We have been praying about it and we have decided to heed to the Lord’s word. The name Indosakusa (the morning star is deeper than Impumelelo Shining Stars. At first, we were many stars, but now we are following one morning star just like the star which the wise men followed,” Siziba said. Siziba also said they had not parted ways with ways with their manager, Christian Sibanda, who is based in South Africa. “We are still with Sibanda, who is based in South Africa, where we get more bookings. We have had good working relations with Sibanda, who is also a relative of one of our group members,” he said. The group, which held their corporate and media launch last week at Hope Centre, will host a public launch for fans soon.
