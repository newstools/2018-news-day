Caps United Football Club is set to lose property worth over $10 460 after its former communications officer, Joyce Kapota, successfully obtained a writ of execution following the registration of her arbitral award as a court order. BY SPORTS REPORTER The relationship between Kapota and Caps United is said to have deteriorated sometime in 2014 after former’s employment contract was terminated on notice and she then approached the Labour Court for recourse. In his determination, labour officer, one L Sigauke, said it was not in dispute that Kapota’s contract was terminated on notice and also that she was owed. Sigauke further said what was in dispute was the quantum, which he proceeded to award after deliberating on the matter. Following Sigauke’s ruling, Kapota made attempts to have her quantified amount paid by the football club, but with no luck, prompting her to approach the High Court for the registration of the arbitral award early February this year. However, when the matter was heard, the award was registered as an order of the court, which she then used to apply for a writ of execution which was granted on February 26, 2018. Part of the writ addressed to the Sheriff of the High Court reads: “You are required and directed to attach and take into execution the movable goods of Caps United, the above mentioned defendant, of 1 Carriesbrook Road, Eastlea, Harare, and of the same cause to be realised the sum of $10 460, which applicant (Kapota) recovered by judgment of this court dated February 6, 2018, in the above mentioned suit and also all the other costs and charges of the applicant in the said suit to be hereafter duly taxed according to law, besides all your costs thereby incurred.” Kapota was represented by Coghlan, Welsh and Guest.
