After the successful inaugural edition of the Youth Entrepreneurship Programme (YEP), diversified financial services group, CBZ Holdings, this week launched the much awaited second edition of the Youth Entrepreneurs Program (YEP) with a major investment of $110,000 for the year 2017 (up from  S$48,000 in 2016). In partnership with the Empowered Life Trust, CBZ Holdings Youth Entrepreneurs Program is a practical and results-based initiative to produce growth-oriented (not survivalist) profitable businesses that are run professionally by youth from all 10 Provinces in Zimbabwe. YEP is nurturing a new generation of (growth oriented) business persons. Many young Zimbabweans graduating from universities, colleges and high schools have no option but to become entrepreneurs due to lack of employment. The program seeks to improve Zimbabwe youths including those who are in the rural areas through offering business opportunities which will in turn create employment opportunities. <img src="https://www.newsday.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/YEP-BINDURA-2.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3096224743986761" srcset="https://www.newsday.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/YEP-BINDURA-2.jpg 640w, https://www.newsday.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/YEP-BINDURA-2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.newsday.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/YEP-BINDURA-2-30x23.jpg 30w, https://www.newsday.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/YEP-BINDURA-2-90x68.jpg 90w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /> YEP is in line with the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe`s 2016-2020 National Financial Inclusion Strategy as part of efforts to foster economic and social development by increasing fiscal space for previously marginalised key players such as smallholder farmers, women, youth, micro-small to medium scale enterprises in the formal banking system. The 2016 edition saw over 1000 young people from the country’s 10 provinces receiving extensive training – 20 received seed money to inject into their businesses, 10 provincial winners were rewarded while Pinky Sipho Mudzingwa from Midlands walked away with the top prize of US$3,000.00 with Kuda Chinya (Harare) and Alson Jasi (Bulawayo walking away with the 1st runner up (US$2,000.00) and 2nd runner (US$1,500.00) up prizes respectively. An online portal was also launched to facilitate further training for those that received the initial training. <img src="https://www.newsday.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/YEP-BULAWAYO-3-e1520255511305.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3096224743986763" /> This is enhanced through our weekly motivational radio show on StarFM, Shot in the Arm (every Wednesday from 9.30am to 10am).
