Zimbabwe men and women’s water polo teams disappointed at FINA World Championships in Durban South Africa last week, finishing on position 14 out of 19 countries. BY FREEMAN MAKOPA The men competed against South Africa and Egypt, while the ladies team played against South Africa. Zimbabwe Aquatic Union president Mary Kloppers attributed the low performance to lack of exposure in international tournaments for the locals. “The level of skill of the South African and Egyptian teams was far superior to us, and that is why we failed to win any of our games,” she said. “Other teams were more skilful than ours, so we still have to work hard if we are to get better results in future.” Kloppers also bemoaned lack of resources to train athletes. “The other countries are exposed to much more competition, which we are lacking mainly due to limited resources, especially to travel to take part in international competitions.”
