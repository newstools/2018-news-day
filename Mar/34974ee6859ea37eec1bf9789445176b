Triathlon Zimbabwe (TZ) says the national team is ready to participate at this year’s edition of the Rabat ATU Triathlon African Championships scheduled for April 21 and 22 in Morroco. BY FREEMAN MAKOPA It will be a hive of activity in Rabat, as African triathletes converge on the city, which will host also the mixed relays championship as well as the para triathlon events, while the Duathlon Long Distance Championship will be in Luxor (Egypt) this October. Triathlon Zimbabwe president Rick Fulton told NewsDay Sport that the athletes are finalising their preparations. “We are now ready for the tournament and I hope for this year we will achieve something given that we have been staging various competitions locally to prepare for the event,” he said. “The triathletes will be hoping to do well in Morocco ahead of the Youth Olympic Games (YOG) to be held in Buenos Aires in October 2018.  The road to YOG will be long and hard but will also be fun and we expect to have a lot new comers.” Fulton added that there would be no guarantees for places for the YOG squad. According to him, there are several other events that would be used to select athletes for the games. “These young athletes will have to compete in various events this year because none of them is guaranteed an automatic place.” Two females and an equal number in the male category will qualify for the Youth Olympic Games.
