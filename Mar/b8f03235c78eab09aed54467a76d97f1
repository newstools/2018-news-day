AN all-female Bulawayo gospel outfit, Women of Valour, is set to release its debut 14-track DVD album self-titled today. BY SINDISO DUBE The album was recorded in May last year at the Bulawayo Academy of Music. The project visionary, Blessing Sitotombe — who runs it with his wife gospel songbird Lorraine Maplanka Sitotombe, told Southern Eye Life & Style that the concept was meant to promote women in music. “This concept serves to promote women in music, a gifted breed that goes with little attention time and again as the world of gospel music in Zimbabwe evolves. “We aim at launching the different talents that these ladies possess and set them on a path to a great music career,” said the visionary. “With the help of The Outfit band, we hope to set off many other gifted talent in our society through this production brand.” Women of Valour will be done annually, encompassing songs, dance and poetry. Sitotombe urged people to buy the music and support the women as a way of inspiring them. He said preparations for Volume 2 were already underway.
