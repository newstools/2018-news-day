ZORA music genius Leonard Karikoga Zhakata is scheduled to perform in Manicaland where he is expected to reconnect with his fans on Friday and Saturday. BY CLAYTON MASEKESA Zhakata, undoubtedly one of the country’s finest musicians, confirmed through his manager, Ben Zhakata, that he will be performing at Matombo Night Club in Nyanga on Friday before gracing Club Mandisa in Mutare the following day. “We will be in Nyanga on Friday and this is a special show because we last performed there about 15 months ago when mdara (Zhakata) was still together with Thomas Makion,” he said. “Obviously, the people there are hungry for our music. A lot has happened at Zora music and the fans must brace for a nice time,” Zhakata said, adding that Mutare was one of their strongholds. “It is one and half years now since we last performed in Mutare. So, we will be reconnecting with our Zora cadres in Mutare. Our fans must come in their numbers in both shows because we have new dances and songs.” Zhakata has been holding a series of shows around the country and this has led promoters in Manicaland to court him. “There is no doubt that Zhakata is one of Zimbabwe’s music powerhouses. We are happy to host a musician of such calibre. We are ready for the show and we encourage the fans to come early for this high profile show,” Boniface Nyamanhindi the Club Mandisa owner said. Of late Zhakata and his Zimbabwe All Stars ensemble have been on whirlwind tours across the country reconnecting with his fans.
