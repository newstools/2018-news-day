THE High Court has ordered embattled MDC-T deputy president, Thokozani Khupe and her followers to vacate the party’s Bulawayo offices they grabbed on March 4, as she challenged Nelson Chamisa’s recent nomination as substantive party leader. BY SILAS NKALA Since March 4, Khupe and her group occupied the party offices and blocked the provincial leadership led by Gift Banda to use the facility. On Wednesday, Banda filed an urgent application at the Bulawayo High Court seeking  Khupe’s eviction which was granted by Justice Maxwell Takuva yesterday. “The defendants must vacate the offices and give access of the premises to the applicants,” ruled Takuva. In his urgent High Court chamber application, Banda through his lawyers Mathonsi Law Chambers,  sought an order barring Khupe and her allies from disrupting and interfering with party business. “I submit that this matter is urgent because as a province we have nowhere else to operate from as all lawful structures of the party under my control and supervision have been excluded from accessing the offices at a critical time when we are processing candidate selection and preparing for crucial elections,” Banda said in his founding affidavit. “I seek this honourable court’s protection and intervention on an urgent basis from the unlawful actions of the respondents in despoiling me of control and occupation of our provincial offices.”
