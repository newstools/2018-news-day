FC PLATINUM pacey winger Marshal Mudehwe will be out of action for at least two months after sustaining a hamstring injury in last weekend’s 2-0 home win over Yadah Stars. BY TERRY MADYAUTA Mudehwe was on target with a fine first half strike to cap a solid performance in the match, but was later stretchered off the field in tears following the muscle strain. The 24-year-old has already clearly established himself as the team’s mainstay and his absence will undoubtedly come as a big blow to the platinum
miners. Stand-in coach Lizwe Sweswe admits the winger’s absence is a huge setback for his side, who are aiming a second successive league title. “It is definitely a big blow for us as a team because he was on fire,” Sweswe said. “He actually scored a great goal for us last weekend, which was a pointer to the kind of season he was headed to. “This injury came at a time when we didn’t expect but I hope he will be back to play in no time.” He was also impressive in FC Platinum’s short-lived stay in the Caf Champions League, where they were knocked out in the preliminary round.
