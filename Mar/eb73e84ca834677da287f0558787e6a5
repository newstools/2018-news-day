Zanu PF-aligned cleric and Destiny for Afrika Network founder, Obadiah Musindo has claimed that G-40 members who had captured the State before the resignation of former President Robert Mugabe comprised of known homosexuals, whose agenda was to legalise the loathed practice in the country. By Tinotenda Munyukwi Addressing clerics who are set to benefit from his housing schemes ahead of this year’s election, Musindo claimed Operation Restore Legacy which ousted Mugabe, was sanctioned by God to save the nation from named homosexuals who wanted to introduce the practice in the country. “Operation Restore Legacy that was done by the soldiers helped us in one thing, because State House had been captured by gays, not from opposition, but from Zanu PF.
“Temba Mliswa was clear on who these gays are, so restore legacy saved us from the kingdom of gays who had infiltrated State House. “If these guys had managed to secure power (G40), it was (homosexuality) going to be legalised. Some people really know that this one is this one’s wife. Right now you will have been doing all night prayers asking why God had done these things to you,” Musindo said amid applause from the congregation of pastors. Musindo also warned the President Emmerson Mnangagwa administration against abusing power in the same  manner Mugabe and G40 members did,  as God will remove it because he only ordains leaders who were willing to serve his people. “What Mugabe did was not good for the country, and if this leadership of Mnangagwa, (VP Kembo) Mohadi and (VP Constantino) Chiwenga forgets the people, I tell you that God shall remove them. If Mnangagwa is there to serve himself, then he has no business with God,” Musindo said.
