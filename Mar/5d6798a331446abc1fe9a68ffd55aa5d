CELEBRATED Isichatamiya gospel group Impumelelo Shining Stars have rebranded to Indosakusa the Morning Star after 17 years in the music industry in a development that group leader Oscar Siziba described as God-inspired. BY SINDISO DUBE The award-winning group unveiled their new name and image at a colourful ceremony at Hope Centre in Bulawayo last Friday. The event was well-attended by industry gurus including Jeys Marabini and IYASA director Nkululeko Dube. Trading with the pay-off line:“Dawn has come, joy comes in the morning”, the group unveiled their new image with a splendid performance of their new song dubbed Indosakusa which talks of a new beginning and breaking new boundaries. “We are a praying group that moves and works with God’s vision. What we have done, is God- inspired, it’s been two years since God gave us a revelation and since then he has been talking to us about rebranding and finding ourselves and this had to be fulfilled. Indosakusa is a new beginning and we will be torch bearers in the music industry,” Siziba said. He said the group’s past projects would not be affected by the change in name and would continue to be sold and distributed under the old name. With nine albums under their belt, the group has perfomed many times in South Africa, in Zimbabwe they have featured at Harare International festival of arts, Intwasa, Ibumba and other festivals. In 2013 they collaborated with five-time Grammy award winners Ladysmith Black Mambazo on the album Amaqhinga Aphelile, recorded at United Rhythm Studio.
