Mobile operator, NetOne has compensated subscribers on its OneFusion package, who were affected by challenges relating to bundles in line with a directive from the postal and telecoms regulator. BY BUSINESS REPORTER On Monday, the affected subscribers received 150MB of data valid for 30 days, with SMS confirmation notifications to more than 177 000 customers. In an interview, NetOne acting chief executive officer, Brian Mutandiro, said the move was in tandem with the Postal and Telecommunications Regulatory Authority of Zimbabwe (Potraz) directive to compensate the affected consumers in accordance with the prejudice they endured. “The move to compensate customers commenced in January 2018 after we noted, with concern, the numerous complaints from customers regarding the OneFusion package. As NetOne, we pride ourselves in customer centricity, offering an affordable, value for money sustainable world class service,” he said. Last month, Potraz ordered NetOne to compensate subscribers, who were affected by a glitch in the mobile operator’s billing system. The regulator also requested NetOne to provide a database of the affected subscribers to the regulator by February 28. “The authority has noted the billing challenges you are facing with the OneFusion product. We also noted that you have sent communication to your subscribers advising and admitting the same challenges,” Potraz wrote. “Given the extent and magnitude of complaints raised to the regulator by the subscribers, we, hereby, direct you to compensate the affected consumers in accordance with the prejudice they endured. This is done in the spirit of promoting the consumers’ rights to complain and redress.” NetOne has seen a growth in subscriber base driven by the OneFusion product. OneFusion has become a game changer in the industry due to its affordability as well as compatibility, as it fuses voice, messages and data on one bundle.
