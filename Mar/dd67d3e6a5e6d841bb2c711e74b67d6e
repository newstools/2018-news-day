FEMALE workers at the Department of Immigration in Harare have approached police, seeking clearance to demonstrate against their “sexually abusive” bosses on Friday. BY GARIKAI TUNHIRA Workers’ representative, Nkosana Mtunzi, in a letter addressed to Harare Central Police Station, and dated March 8, 2018, wrote: “I write to your esteemed office as the representative of immigration staff seeking clearance to stage the above-stated demonstration. We will be handing a petition both to the ministers of Home Affairs and Gender respectively.” The letter was copied to the Harare Central district intelligence officer. Mtunzi said they expected 100 people, including gender activists to participate in the planned demonstration. Last week, Parliament heard of several cases of female workers impregnated by their bosses. Appearing before the Magna Mudyiwa-led Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare, two females – Sheila Moyo and Emily Mupeti – broke down in tears, as they narrated their abuse and subsequent suspension by a named top immigration official after they rejected his sexual advances in 2017.
