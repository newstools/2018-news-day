RENOWNED poet, Chirikure Chirikure has been confirmed as an affiliate artist for the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco) Refugee Integration through languages and the Arts (Rila). BY WINSTONE ANTONIO Chirikure told NewsDay Life & Style yesterday that he was honoured by the opportunity to contribute to efforts to address refugee issues. “It is so humbling to be part of such a crucial global initiative. Zimbabwe and Africa in general have been affected and are still affected by migration issues. We need as many interventions as possible to address these challenges,” he said. “Artistes are part and parcel of society. Our works are inspired by society. Thus, our art should also give back to society. Zimbabwe is part of the community of nations, and, as such, our art should always contribute to global initiatives of this nature.” According to the University of Glasgow’s website, the Rila network brings together artistes from various backgrounds, who reflect on the role arts and languages play in bringing people together and strengthening social cohesion. “Refugee integration is a process that involves three actors, refugees, artistes and the host country. This means the thinking needs to take place in all three areas, with a strong focus on hospitality and cultural and linguistic exchange,” the website reads. “Our affiliate artistes all use these themes in their work and we encourage them to find partners within the network, to set up international projects and partnerships.”
Chirikure Chirikure is a well-travelled artiste, who has staged performances at several festivals across the globe and some of his works have been published in multiple languages that include German and Chinese.
