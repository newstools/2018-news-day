Police in Spain have rescued 39 women and girls who were smuggled over from Nigeria, kept in caves and forced to sell sex. BBC They were coerced into leaving home with voodoo threats, then exploited as prostitutes to pay back 30,000 euro (£26,209) debts. According to Europol, the criminal cartel had links to the Eiye brotherhood, one of the most influential fraternities in Nigeria. The gang was allegedly operating clandestinely all over the world – pumping money back into the network. Some 89 people were arrested during raids last November, including a famous, but as yet unnamed DJ, accused of acting as a pimp across a number of provinces. He was caught flying back into Spain after recording a music video. Detectives at Europol described it as one of the largest operations against human trafficking in Europe.
