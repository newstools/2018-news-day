A SOUTH African truck spilled 30 000 litres of hazardous sulphuric acid after the trailer caught fire in unclear circumstances. By Nokuthaba Dlamini The incident happened last Thursday evening and the driver escaped unhurt. The truck, whose destination could not be established, belonged to MBS Carriers and was heading to Kazungula border post. Police officer commanding Victoria Falls district, Chief superintendent Jairos Chiwona confirmed the accident. “The truck was being driven by a Harare driver, Rangarirai Muchenisi, along Kazungula Road, approximately 20 kilometres from town. According to the statement he gave, he said it caught fire due to an electrical fault as he suspected,” he said. “After realising that the trailer was alight, he disconnected the horse and that is why he managed to escape unharmed.” Efforts to get a comment from Muchenisi were unfruitful, as his mobile phone  went unanswered. A massive decontamination exercise is in progress, with authorities ensuring that the dangerous chemical does not harm humans and wildlife. Environmental Management Authority official, Chipo Zuze, said they were on the ground trying to mop up the acid. Last year, another South African truck spilled 34 000 litres of sulphuric acid along Bulawayo-Victoria Falls near Inyatue River, a major water source for Dete villagers.
