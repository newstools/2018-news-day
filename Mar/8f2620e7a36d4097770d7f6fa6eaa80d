EXECUTIVE producer of popular high-definition soap opera Wenera, Eddie Ndhlovu, yesterday said he will be travelling to the United States (US) later this month to share his testimony of the blockbuster series that airs weekly on ZBC TV. BY WINSTONE ANTONIO Ndhlovu told NewsDay Life &Style yesterday that he would use the trip, which will see him visit five states, to sell the Zimbabwean story. “Our primary audience and focus is on Zimbabwean audiences. We want to lure investors to start investing in our local productions. Wenera has grown big now and we want to use it as one of the flagship productions to show that we can produce even more competitive and world class productions,” he said. Ndhlovu said his production house, Talent of Steel, was prepared and committed to producing 30 hours of television content every month if they get the opportunity.
“With digitalisation coming, we do believe it will be an opportunity for us to help the cause and not only producing, but creating stable and long term employment in our communities,” he said. Ndlovu said it was amazing how people outside the country appreciated Wenera, which is based on the Musodza family, who run Wenera Diamonds firm, and how the family operates like a mafia, with jealousy, disloyalty and blackmail as a way of life. Ndlovu said the invite follows the visit by an American who had the chance to watch the soap during his Zimbabwe visit last year and later invited him to share his testimony of the story. He saluted his production team for inspiring him.
