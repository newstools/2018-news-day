ME Fest Culture Expo, which was temporarily shelved mid last year due to financial constraints, is set to make a return this Saturday under the theme Ubuntu/Hunhu at Mai Musodzi Hall in Mbare. BY WINSTONE ANTONIO The festival, organised by Simba Arts Trust, will incorporate a business workshop under the theme Arts as a Profession as well as traditional and cultural performances. The trust’s secretary Debra Whitney Matiyanga told NewsDay Life & Style yesterday that they were optimistic the festival would grow this year. “The Me Fest is a project assembled to establish a clean performing platform for artistes after realising that performance was held mainly in most unfavourable places for children and youth with slots given to experienced groups hence we had to do something to provide a grooming ground for artistes,” she said. Matiyanga said the festival will maintain its monthly format, as part of their efforts to promote the arts sector and Zimbabwean culture in general. “The ME Fest Culture Expo is part of the broader initiatives to uphold Zimbabwe’s cultural values. As Simba Arts, we strive to play an important role in promoting cultural exchange programmes within the country and beyond,” she said. Matiyanga said the festival also provided exchange programmes involving several countries. Simba Arts Trust, a dynamic community-oriented performing arts movement was established in 1997 in the high-density suburb of Mbare to empower young people to find and create jobs out of art, and ensure that art contributes to economic development.
