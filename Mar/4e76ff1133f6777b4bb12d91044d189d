LOCAL gospel group Wired 2 Worship was recently voted into the semi-finals of the International Global Song contest with the song, Chara Chimwe, ahead of the finals scheduled for Peru in July this year. BY TAFADZWA KACHIKO The group joined other international acts including Clean Bandit, Jason Derulo and Nicki Minaj. Derulo and Minaj entered the semi-finals with Swalla, which has attracted over 700 million views on YouTube and United Kingdom’s Clean Bandit with Rockabye, which also has millions of views. The competition started in 2012 with a goal to unite countries and enable them to showcase their music talent and respective cultures. Group chairman Algy Madzura was very excited to have reached the semi-finals. He said the song was worth it, since they spent sleepless nights working on it. “When I learnt that we were voted into the semi-finals, I was both excited and shocked. We, however, deserved that because we had spent sleepless nights working on this amazing song. It has received more nominations at a global platform compared to; our own local platforms,” Madzura said. The song, produced by Clive “Mono” Mukundu, features Mellisa Makwasha from ZimPraise, Naphtali Chivandikwa, Pastor G and Derrick Mpofu. Wired 2 Worship was once nominated to represent Zimbabwe at America’s Global Peace Song and All Africa Song contest, but did not garner adequate votes due to lack of publicity. Madzura expressed confidence that this time around they were making it to the finals. “The downside of these contests has been on low marketing and publicity. That affected our numbers. This time around we are pushing for mainstream media to support us and taking advantage of social media,” he said.
