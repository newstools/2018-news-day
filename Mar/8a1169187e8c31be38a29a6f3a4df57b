THE junior councillor for high schools in Bulawayo, Daniel Nxumalo, has been selected to represent Zimbabwe at the 2018 edition of the World Championships of Performing Arts (WCOPA) scheduled for July 1 to 15 in Hollywood, United States. BY SHARON SIBINDI The 17-year-old actor told NewsDay Life & Style that he was selected by Zimbabwe Championships of the Performing Arts during auditions in March last year. “I will be performing a variety of pieces within one minute per piece in the actors’ category. I went for auditions at the Bulawayo Amphitheatre last year. I performed a one-minute monologue and was judged based on my performance. Through this practice, I hope the people will like my performance,” he said. “Performers from over 60 different countries around the world come to compete in various categories such as dance, modelling, singing, acting, instrumentals (like guitars and maybe the mbira) and even spoken word poetry.” The championships are run by former Miss Universe chief executive officer, Griff O’Neil and are often referred to as the “Olympics” of the performing arts.
This is the third successive year that Zimbabwe will be competing at the championships. Nxumalo said he was excited to be performing at the global show, which attracted scouts, managers and universities offering scholarships and jobs to young and upcoming talent from the competition. The teenager appealed to the corporate world for sponsorship, as he was supposed to fund his trip to, and stay in the United States. “Unfortunately, this comes at a cost and we, as contestants, have to fundraise in order to go. I will be competing in the actors’ category and I need help in getting the funds to go there,” he said. “I have taken part in many different dramas and school productions and received numerous awards,” he said.
