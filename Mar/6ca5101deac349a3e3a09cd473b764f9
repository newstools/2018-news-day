THE MDC-T’s top executive yesterday pressed the Sadc Electoral Advisory Council to pile pressure on President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s government to implement all electoral reforms demanded by the opposition, ahead of this year’s general elections. BY OBEY MANAYITI The team met MDC-T president Nelson Chamisa, his deputy Elias Mudzuri, Douglas Mwonzora (secretary general) Theresa Makone (treasurer), Murisi Zvizvai (elections
director), Lynette Karenyi-Kore (women’s assembly) and Happymore Chidziva (youth assembly) to gather their views on the country’s preparedness for the elections.
 “The meeting went on very well and we talked about our displeasure over a number of issues,” Mwonzora said. “They include the fact that we need an audit of the voters’ roll, we need to supervise the printing of the ballot papers, the diaspora vote, equal access to media, eradication of violence and intimidation, demilitarisation of Zec, that election must be AU/Sadc guaranteed, abuse of the traditional leaders and full compliance of the Sadc guidelines for free and fair elections.” At one stage, the MDC-T embarked on a ‘No Reform No Election’ campaign to pressure government and the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission to reform the election roadmap and level the political playing field. In a statement after meeting  the Sadc team, MDC-T’s director of communications, Luke Tamborinyoka, expressed concern over non-implementation of their demanded reforms. “The party also told the Sadc observer team that Zimbabweans wanted the army to undo their previous statements that they would not salute a President who did not participate in the liberation struggle by making a clear and unequivocal statement that they will this time respect the sovereign will of the people,” he said.
