THE upcoming Africa Factbook stakeholders’ consultative conference will bring key stakeholders within African economies towards publishing a comprehensive resource tool on the African continent. BY BUSINESS REPORTER The stakeholders will be brought together at the Africa Factbook conference in Harare on Monday by the Book of African Records (BAR) in partnership with African Union Commission and Research Council of Zimbabwe. In a concept note of the conference, the organisers said the Africa Factbook sought to cover gaps in the continuum of knowledge management in particular the absence of a comprehensive reference source on Africa by Africans. “For Africa to develop, its governments, researchers, thinkers, academics, business and populace in general need true, scientific and comprehensive information about the economies, geography, politics and planning, policy formulation and/or monitoring and evaluation of the African development agenda,” the note read. “However, despite all its strides and potential for development, Africa still lacks an authentic and comprehensive home-grown source of data and information. “… in essence, the Africa Factbook will serve as a reference source for useful facts about Africa and the African people for the purpose of information dissemination, education, entertainment, reference, statistics and documentation.” The aim of the conference will be to publish the Africa Factbook which will have extensive information on the African continent that can be used to develop the continent. Earlier this week, BAR founder and editor-in-chief, Kwame Muzawazi said at least 120 delegates were targeted to attend. He said the delegates were not limited to official representatives of governments (mostly ambassadors), businesses, philanthropists, potential funders, academics and researchers, African regional economic communities, publishers, statisticians, inter-governmental agencies and non-governmental organisations among others.
