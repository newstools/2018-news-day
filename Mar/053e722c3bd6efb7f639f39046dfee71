The report by Potraz, the authority that regulates the telecommunications industry in Zimbabwe, showed that in the fourth quarter, Econet’s customer market share jumped to 53.1% in Q4, up from 51.7% in the previous quarter. Zimbabwe’s telecommunications industry is dominated by three licenced mobile network operators – Econet Wireless Zimbabwe and State owned NetOne and Telecel Zimbabwe – whose combined total number of active subscribers grew to by 2.1% to 14,092,104 from 13,799,648 in the previous quarter, according to the industry report. The report showed that the sector growth in subscriber numbers was largely driven by Econet’s growth in active customers of 4.9% in Q4, where NetOne grew its subscribers by 1.8%, and Telecel lost 8.2% of its active subscribers. The report revealed that Econet’s voice traffic market share slightly eased to 78.2%, from 80.9% in the previous quarter, while Telecel`s voice market share remained unchanged at 7%, and NetOne took on a 1.9% increase in share of voice traffic, going up to 14% in Q4 from 12.1% recorded in the previous quarter.

While the report showed NetOne increasing its share of total mobile data usage by 6.5% (with Econet and Telecel’s usage dipping by 5.5% and 1.1% respectively) the growth in usage by NetOne does not translate into growth in revenue market share. The sector performance report showed that NetOne’s revenue market share dropped from 12.1% in Q3, to 10.8% in Q4  – possibly owing to unbilled usage from heavily discounted promotions. On the infrastructure investment front, the report showed Econet leading in the investment of mobile base stations in which it deployed 65 base stations in Q4. In the same period Telecel deployed 31 additional base stations, while NetOne deployed a net addition of 4 base stations in the quarter.

The growth was at the expense of rival mobile money services which both lost market share, with NetOne’s rebranded and relaunched OneMoney declining from 1.3% to 1.1%, while Telecel’s TeleCash went down from 2% to 1.7%. The Potraz report revealed that the total number of active mobile money agents in the sector grew from 22.604 in Q3 to 27.284 in Q4, driven by Ecocash, which grew its active agent network base by 31%, from 20.039 in Q3 to 26,247 in Q4 of 2017.
