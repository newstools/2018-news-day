Three daring robbers who pounced at a private property owned by former President Robert Mugabe’s daughter, Bona Chikore and got away with goods worth $4 800, were yesterday slapped with 30 months jail term each. BY DESMOND CHINGARANDE Robson Kandenga (45), Peter Mangwiro (40) and Brighton Chisiko (30) will, however, serve an effective 18 months jail time each after regional magistrate Noel Mupeiwa suspended 12 months on condition of good behaviour. Asked by Mupeiwa why they committed the offence the three said they wanted to raise funds for their families. The court heard that on December 31 last year at around 1am the convicts armed themselves with metal bars and stormed the premises in Harare’s Umwinsdale suburb. As soon as the police officer guarding the property came out of the guardroom, one of the convicts disarmed him of his AK service rifle. They started assaulting him with metal bars, booted feet and open hands before tying  the complainant on both hands and legs using construction tying wire which they picked at the site. The gang stole $15 cash, a wallet containing the officer’s identification particulars, two mobile phones and Nokia and 80 wooden construction boards. They later loaded the loot on a hired truck and drove off. The stolen goods were disposed at Siyaso, Magaba in Mbare. Police only recovered one wooden construction board which was positively identified by one Howard Karima of Hualong Construction Company.
