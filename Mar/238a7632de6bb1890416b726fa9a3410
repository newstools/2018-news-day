NAIROBI — Kenya Airways reported yesterday nine-month pre-tax loss of 5,97 billion shillings ($59,3 million) and an after tax loss of 6,1 billion shillings, hurt by a prolonged election period in the country and rising fuel prices. Reuters Nine-month operating profit stood at 1,3 billion shillings, acting chief financial officer Hellen Mwariri said. Kenya spent most of 2017 conducting elections, which in addition to effects of drought, hit economic growth. The elections contributed to a 20% drop in domestic traffic, including in its East Africa markets, chief executive, Sebastian Mikosz said. The airline, which is changing its financial year to match the calendar year, said passenger numbers stood at 3,4 million in the nine months to end-December. The airline completed a $2 billion debt restructuring in November as part of revival plans after a drop in Kenyan travel and high financing costs on new Boeing jets resulted in the country’s biggest ever corporate loss 26 billion shillings in its 2016 financial year. Kenya Airways reported pre-tax loss for the full year to end March 2017 of 10,2 billion shillings, while after tax loss was 9,96 billion shillings. Operating profit was 897 million shillings.
