It has taken almost a month for Nigeria’s President Muhammadu Buhari to visit Dapchi – the town where 110 girls were snatched by Boko Haram militants. BBC But – as we reported yesterday – he has finally made it there. Unfortunately, the visit does not appear to have left either parents or Nigerian social media users impressed, after pictures emerged of his large entourage and the red carpet which was rolled out on his arrival. Mr Buhari – who promised “there will be no rest” until the schoolgirls were found – and his crew flew in on at least six helicopters to address the students, relatives and teachers of the kidnapped girls on Wednesday. It led one mother of two missing girls to question where those soldiers were when her daughters were taken. The president’s huge security entourage, she said, was upsetting to see. Others told the BBC they were not reassured by President Buhari’s words and many are still angry at the lack of action by the government immediately after the attack.
