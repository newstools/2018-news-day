FC PLATINUM head coach Norman Mapeza has reportedly quit the Zvishavane-based club. Sources last night said his departure came after the clubâ€™s heavy defeat last week Wednesday in the Confederations of African Football Champions League, where they were bundled out on an embarrassing 5-1 aggregate scoreline by Angolan side Clube Desportivo de Agosto. The club held a crisis meeting last night to map the way forward.
