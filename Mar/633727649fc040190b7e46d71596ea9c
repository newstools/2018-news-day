BY LIFE & STYLE REPORTER Dubbed “Countdown to Album Release”, the gig will also see Faheem Somanje and his Pengaudzoke crew perform as curtain raisers. The Pengaudzoke frontman is also expected to sample new songs off his forthcoming second album to be released in a few months. Legends Sports Diner proprietor Daniel Masaiti said the gig is meant for the Madhawu hitmaker to perform new songs, as part of the countdown to his latest album. “It is always an honour to host Macheso in Marondera, for he is the crowd favourite.
