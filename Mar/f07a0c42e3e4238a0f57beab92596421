THE Basketball Union of Zimbabwe (BUZ) will use this month’s inter-provincial tournament set for Marondera to select national Under-18 teams that will compete in the Afro-Basketball qualifiers in Mozambique this May. BY FREEMAN MAKOPA The Interprovincial tournament is scheduled to run from March 27 to 29. BUZ president Joe Mujuru said preparations were at an advanced stage for the hosting of the tourney. “We are ready to host this year’s interprovincial tournament in Marondera and I can safely say all the provinces are doing final touch-ups. “This tournament will be used to select the best under 18 players from all the provinces to be part of the national team that is going to travel to Mozambique in May. All the provinces should ensure they send their teams so that their players get a chance to be selected,” he said. The tournament will also feature senior teams that will battle it out for top honours at the same tournament. Harare Basketball Association president, Sani Mbofana (pictured) expressed confidence that there will have players who will make into the team. “I’m quite confident our players will be in the team as we have been preparing hard for this tournament, but we are still facing some challenges that include lack of sponsorship, “he said. Meanwhile, BUZ has started initiatives to revive the sport in all provinces, with the aim of establishing leagues across the country. Currently, it is Harare which has a viable league and provides the bulk of the players to the national team whenever there is an international assignment.
