The Nigerian government has confirmed that 76 of the 110 abducted Dapchi school girls have been released. BBC Garba Shehu, a spokesman for Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari, told the BBc that the girls had returned home. A subsequent statement from the Ministry of Information said that 76 of the girls were released “in the early hours of Wednesday.” Alhaji Lai Mohammed, the Minister of Information and Culture said that the girls were returned through “back-channel efforts and with the help of some friends of the country.” ”Within the period when the girls were being brought back, operational pause was observed in certain areas to ensure free passage and also that lives were not lost,” Mr Mohammed said. He added that the number of released girls would be updated when all had been formally registered.
