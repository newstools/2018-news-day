AFRO fusion musician Remias Tafireyi (37) — better known as Moyondizvo in music circles — has scored a first by snatching a collabo with celebrated Ghanaian musician Yussif Mohammed Cisse . BY LIFE & STYLE REPORTER The collaboration gave birth to a love song titled You Are Too Sweet, which is likely to become a soundtrack for many love relationships. “My collaboration with Leety (as Cisse is popularly known) came easily because, unlike most international stars, he is a humble person and didn’t demand anything in return for the duet,” Moyondizvo said. “I am happy that we worked together to produce a sound I believe will grow our individual careers and take our art to international levels.” The musician said he was hopeful the collaboration would open up more opportunities for him. “Beyond broadening my sound, I believe working with Leety alone will expose me to great opportunities given his experience and networks,” he said, adding that the Ghanaian was a celebrated musician and producer. Moyondizvo is not new in music circles. He has released three albums to date — Kuyaruka, Dzimbaware and Ndati Ndirevewo. The gifted guitarist and vocalist said music had always been his first love and believes he has a lot to offer the local music industry. He said his lifelong love for music helped him deal with the lose of his parents when he was just 17. “I have faced many challenges but I am grateful for the support I continue getting from my family and other fellow musicians,” he said. Leety, who is currently based in South Africa, said he was excited to be working with Moyondizvo.
