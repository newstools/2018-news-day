FORMER Caps United attacker Amon Kambanje has joined Zvishavane-based soccer side Shabanie Mine, after being shown the exit door by Lloyd Chitembwe  at the Harare giants. BY TERRY MADYAUTA The versatile 22-year-old winger joins the asbestos miners as Farai Mupasiri’s direct replacement, after the former moved to Shabanie’s cross town rivals FC Platinum. Kambanje penned a one-year deal with the Chinda boys. Club chairman Tavazive Mhloro confirmed Kambanje’s move. “I can confirm that Amon Kambanje is now part of the Shabanie Mine family. We expect him to command a first team jersey and add more energy into the team,” Mhloro said. “Kambanje played at Caps United, which is one of the biggest teams in the country, and we hope that he will be a pillar in our team with the experience he has amassed during his stint at Caps. “He has pledged to work well with the other youngsters at Shabanie Mine, as we aim at performing better than what we did last season. There are other players, who are still knocking on the door, but it’s now up to the coaches to decide. Kambanje has already promised goals for the Chinda boys who survived relegation by a whisker last season. “I am glad to be representing Shabanie Mine this season and I want to be at my best by ensuring that I score as many goals as possible for the team,” he said. “My time at Caps United lapsed but one has to move on and with that I mind, I will  work together with the other players so that we bring glory to Maglas.”
