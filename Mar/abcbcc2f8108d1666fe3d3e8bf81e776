SOUTH Africa-based musician and novelist Rudorwashe Hove says he will release his second album, an Easter holiday offering titled The Passion of Christ today. BY TAFADZWA KACHIKO This is exactly a year after he released his debut album, Tonosangana Gaririya. Hove arrived in Zimbabwe on Saturday and has since started distributing the album to key stakeholders. “My second album is now ready on CD. My aim is to start selling this week. We hope to finish the album on DVD any time soon. So far, three videos have been shot,” he said. “I named it The Passion of Christ because most songs cover the time of Jesus Christ, from when he was tormented to his resurrection. The album is quite different from Tonosangana Gaririya. The album is coming just before Easter when we remember the suffering Christ endured.” Hove said although his debut album did not do well, it helped him to grow his fan base. “Although the debut album didn’t sell, it helped me to evaluate the world’s appreciation to my works since I didn’t have a strong fan base. I have, however, seen it growing gradually, so I am hopeful that this time my music will sell,” he said. The artiste said he was grateful for the support from his fans and promised to nproduce his best in his music ministry. “I hope they will fall in love with this album and we won’t give up until the gospel of Christ is well received,” he said.
The album was produced by Essential Records.
