A Zesa employee has sued the power utility for wrongfully charging him over $18 000, which went missing and was uncovered during an internal audit. BY SILAS NKALA Edgar Mpozori filed an application at the Bulawayo High Court last week, citing Zesa Holdings (Pvt) Limited, as the respondent. In his founding affidavit, Mpozori submitted that he was charged for fraud on the basis on an anonymous letter sent to his employer. “The audit was subsequently carried out in October 2018,” the founding affidavit read in part. “It was then recommended that in review of documentary evidence, I should be charged for failure to account for the sum of $18 800. This is a court application to review audit report by the respondent in terms of section 46 of the High Court Act on the grounds that my rights, as provided for by Administrative Justice Act and the Constitution of Zimbabwe, I am advised that in terms section 69 of the Constitution of Zimbabwe, I have a right to administrative conduct that is lawful, impartial and both subsequently and procedurally fair.” He said when Zesa carried out an audit, his rights to a fair hearing were violated, as he was never consulted or interviewed and given an opportunity to respond to the allegations. “This is, therefore, a violation of my rights provided for in section 68 of the Constitution of Zimbabwe. This violates my rights as provided in section 3 of the Administrative Justice Act. I, therefore, pray that the audit report done by the respondents is declared null and void and a new audit be undertaken in compliance with the principles of administrative justice,” the founding affidavit read. Zesa is yet to respond to the application.
