The discord, pollution and noise within the MDC-T standing committee must come to a screeching halt, if the MDC-T and its partners in the MDC Alliance entertain any hopes of bagging the presidential race and win the bulk of the parliamentary and council seats. By Pardon Maguta,Our Reader The continued stand off and acrimonious relationship between party deputy president, Thokozani Khupe and president, Nelson Chamisa is not good at all. It is confusing ordinary people in rural, urban and other areas. The continued cat-fight, if left spreading like a summer veld fire, will subtract important votes damaging the MDC-T and MDC Alliance leader Chamisa’s chances of defeating President Emmerson Mnangagwa. Disgruntled Khupe symphathisers might also kick the votes into thistle and thorns, as they protest what they view as a deliberate attempt to sideline Khupe on reports of tribalism and patriarchal politics. This needs clarity. The ball is in Chamisa’s court. This is the moment for him to demonstrate his leadership and negotiation skills. The greatest losers, if the impasse between Chamisa and Khupe is not resolved amicably or continues, will be Chamisa and the MDC Alliance. It will be difficult for Chamisa to garner the 50%-plus one vote in the first round of elections. MDC Alliance candidates in both council and parliamentary elections might end up struggling to win the votes if there is a split. A split is a split, no matter how marginal or small it is. Khupe must also accept the fait-accompli. It’s de jure. It’s a fact that the MDC-T national council sat and appointed Chamisa as substantive president. The voters are warming up to a Chamisa national presidency. With that in mind, she must stop swimming against the political tide. She has to join the majority and also respect her party’s constitution. There is power and strength in unity and numbers. MDC-T must unite first before it unites with other parties or its doomed.
