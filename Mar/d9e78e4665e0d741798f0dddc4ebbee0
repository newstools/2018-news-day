Highlanders coach Madinda Ndlovu is happy with the way his project is shaping up, after his youthful side again collected maximum points in a 2-0 win over a battling Herentals at the National Sports Stadium on Sunday. BY GARISH PHIRI The former Highlanders and Warriors forward was handed the reins at Bosso at the start of the season and immediately put together a team consisting largely of youthful stars, whom he believes can challenge for the title. He has so far been impressed with the way his team has imposed itself on the game after registering wins over Triangle and Herentals. Ndlovu was full of praise for Ozias Zibande after he turned the game on its head when he scored  a brace. “It’s about trying to bring back the winning culture which had vanished. We believe in development, we don’t buy players from outside, maybe one or two, but we develop our own,” he said. Ndlovu hailed his team’s efforts despite having been dominated in the first half by Herentals. “We have players like Zibande coming from the bench and score goals for us, that is what he did and it is part of the development that we talking about. Today, he has sent a message to the technical team and it is really amazing how he came to score those goals.” Zibande did not enjoy much game time in the friendlies before the league commenced, but he made his presence felt soon after he came in in the match against Herentals.
Highlanders will be looking up to him again as they prepare for their next home game against Triangle United at Barbourfields Stadium  and then the big clash against Dynamos on Easter Monday. “We train our players to be ready for anything whether we are playing at home or away. I am trying to give these young stars a chance to prove themselves. They are young and still have a lot to learn.”
