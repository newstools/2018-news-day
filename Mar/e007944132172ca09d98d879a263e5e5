MUSIC superstar, Oliver Mtukudzi will tomorrow take his artistry to another level with an acoustic performance at 34 000 feet, aboard a fastjet flight FN 8003 from Harare to Victoria Falls. BY LIFE & STYLE REPORTERS Fastjet Zimbabwe spokesperson, Faith Chaitezvi in a statement, said the performance was part of the airline’s promotion of Victoria Falls as part of their strategy to promote domestic and regional tourism. “In a first for Zimbabwe, passengers travelling on flight FN 8003 this Friday have front row seats to one of the most intimate Tuku performances staged where he will deliver an acoustic set comprising tracks from his latest album Hany’ga (Concern),” she said. “We are passionate about promoting domestic and regional tourism to Zimbabwe, and what better way than to leverage innovative events in partnership with a musical legend.”
Tuku said he was proud to be associated with fastjet.“This is revolutionary for us as well. There is no better interaction with fans than meeting and sharing with them, mid-flight, music from my new album. The party does not end on-board, but will later continue on the Zambezi River with a performance with my band at the Elephant Hills Hotel on Saturday,” he said. Meanwhile, the veteran musician said dancehall chanters Soul Jah Love and Tocky Vibes were his favourite among the younger crop of musicians. Speaking on a local radio station, Tuku said there was lyrical sense in Soul Jah Love’s music. “Soul Jah Love is my favourite because his songs make much lyrical sense even though sometimes it is overshadowed by his behaviour,” he said. The young chanter is an award-winning artiste who rose to prominence in 2012 with hit tracks such as Ndini Uya Uya and Gum-kum.
