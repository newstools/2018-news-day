With Zimbabwe’s economic recovery increasingly becoming elusive, more people are moving into the informal sector as companies  continue to operate at low capacity, unable to employ more staff at a time when the unemployment rate is at over 85 percent. By Felix Machiwenyika In response to this, Zimbabweans in the informal sector have come up with various initiatives, which include home-based projects. Cake artist Sylvia Kaferapanjila  is one of those who have gone out of their way to create a platform for fellow cake artists and bakers to make the best out of the demand for home made confectionary. <img src="https://www.newsday.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG-20180315-WA0007-1.jpg" alt="" width="1052" height="592" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3096224743988199" srcset="https://www.newsday.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG-20180315-WA0007-1.jpg 1052w, https://www.newsday.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG-20180315-WA0007-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.newsday.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG-20180315-WA0007-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.newsday.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG-20180315-WA0007-1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.newsday.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG-20180315-WA0007-1-30x17.jpg 30w" sizes="(max-width: 1052px) 100vw, 1052px" /> What started in 2016 as a Whatsapp group, called Passion Bakers, culminated into  what is now a large project aimed at empowering those that are doing home based baking projects.
