SOUTH Africa-based Zimbabwean gospel musician Macmillan Mahlara has released his third album, Baba Ndinzweiwo, in which he appeals to God to grant him positive fortunes in life and music in 2018. BY ANESU MUSHAWATU Mahlara recorded his first album Rudo Munashe in 2016 and the second Zvaitwa Nenyaya in 2017, but did not get much recognition as he hardly staged shows to market his music. “I took this season as the time to be heard by God. It’s my time to be recognised in the music and industry. Working here (in South Africa) has affected the marketing of my music back home so most of my fans are Zimbabweans based here,” he said. The Holy Praise frontman, who was born in Masvingo, said he would be arriving in Zimbabwe today to start marketing his music and meet potential fans. “I will be home marketing the album via radio stations. I am confident that the Lord will make a way, this is definitely my time,” he said. Mahlara said financial challenges also affected marketing of his music over the years. The eight-track album carries the following tracks Baba Ndinzweiwo, Ndauya, Baba Namai, Pamuchauya, Hondo Dzangu, Kutenda kwaAbraham, Rudo Munashe and Tembere, featuring Nomore Severa.
