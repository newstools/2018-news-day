TERTIARY students on industrial attachment heaved a sigh of relief yesterday when the government slashed their attachment fees by 40% to promote inclusive and quality education in line with Sustainable Development Goals’ Vision 2030. BY TALENT GUMPO In a statement, Higher and Tertiary Education permanent secretary Desire Mutize Sibanda said the students would now be required to pay 60% of tuition fees with immediate effect. “The ministry of Higher and Tertiary Education, Science and Technology is pleased to advise all parents, guardians, sponsors that all higher and tertiary education students on industrial attachment/teaching practice will now be required to pay 60% of tuition fees with immediate effect,” he said. Sibanda said the decision was influenced by the economic environment and the socio-economic status of the majority of the students. “Students on attachment meet the costs of accommodation, food, and transport to and from work. The ministry considered the variable and fixed costs attendant to students’ supervision and utilisation of teaching and learning facilities,” he said. “In reducing the cost to 60% of tuition, the ministry considered that institutions require funds to meet supervisory costs for each student on attachment albeit the majority of students continue to access library and other learning facilities and social developments of the country.” Last year, the Zimbabwe National Students’ Union (Zinasu) petitioned then Higher Education minister Jonathan Moyo demanding the scrapping of attachment fees for all students on industrial attachment. Zinasu secretary-general, Ashley Pfunye said the government should have scrapped 60% of the fees.
