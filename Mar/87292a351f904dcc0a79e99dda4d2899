PRESIDENT Emmerson Mnangagwa yesterday commissioned two new power-generating units at Kariba South Power Station (KPS), which have added an extra 300 megawatts (MW) to the national grid. BY KUDZAI MUCHENJEKWA Officially commissioning unit 7 and 8, which were constructed at a cost of $531 million by China’s Sinohydro, Mnangagwa said the project proved that the government can achieve a lot through collaboration. “We have 300MW, which we will deduct from our import bill. This is the way to go,” he said. Energy minister Simon Khaya Moyo said the commissioning will reduce the country’s import bill. Zimbabwe imports 350MW a month from South Africa’s Eskom and 50MW from Mozambique. Moyo said the government will continue to venture into green energy projects. The expansion Kariba South began in 2014 and was completed on March 10 this year, within budget and time, according to Zesa Holdings. Zimbabwe has not had power cuts in almost two years. The project was completed through a $320 million financing agreement by Export-Import Bank of China, which provided $300 million, while ZPC injected $213 million.
At peak, the project employed 1 505 people.
