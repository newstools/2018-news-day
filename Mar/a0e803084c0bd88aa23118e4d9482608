Since taking over the reins in November through a military-backed transition, President Emmerson Mnangagwa has been on a crusade to lure foreign investors, saying Zimbabwe is open for business. The new administration has been reaching out to foreign investors, with Mnangagwa leading a Zimbabwe delegation to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland in January. Foreign direct investment inflows have been plummeting from a high of $545 million in 2014 to $319 million in 2016 on the back of an unfavourable investment climate.
The new administration has promised to amend indigenisation legislation for the 51:49 threshold to apply only to diamond and platinum. Investors are warming up to the new administration, but want to assess the investment climate after the harmonised elections coming up by
August.
