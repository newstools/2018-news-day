DESPITE his consistent top level performances for his club Bloemfontein Celtic, Ronald Pfumbidzai (pictured)  was surprisingly omitted from the Warriors squad that will do duty in the four nations tournament  scheduled to kick off today with a match between Angola and South Africa. BY TAWANDA TAFIRENYIKA Zimbabwe open their account with a match against Zambia tomorrow. Pfumbidzai was a huge influence as his former club Caps United lifted the championship in 2016, their first since 2005 and his performances the as well as in the Caf Champions League helped him earn a move to South Africa. He played a total of 25 games and contributed the highest number of assists, 19, towards the 42 goals Caps United scored in the campaign. The left back continues to hog the limelight in the ABSA Premiership where he has not missed a match since his transfer from the Green Machine in September last year. Pfumbidzai has played a total of 2430 minutes, including league and cup games since the switch. He has started and finished in all the matches and scored the only goal in the defeat to Mamelodi Sundowns in December last year. He also decided the contest against Ajax Cape Town at the beginning of this month with his solitary strike. When he arrived at Bloemfontein Celtic from CAPS United, his market value stood at $45 000, but it has since shot to $225 000, suggesting incredible progression in his career. But despite his progression he was ignored by coach Sunday Chidzambga who preferred Divine Lunga who has been on off season since November. The assumption is that Chidzambwa wants to have a look at some new players like  England based left back Adam Chicksen who plays for Bradford City in league one-the third tier of English football. Locally based Warriors arrived in Zambia on Monday night while the foreign based players were expected to arrive yesterday. The winner of the Zimbabwe, Zambia clash will meet the winner between South Africa and Angola who play today.
