FC PLATINUM stand-in coach Lizwe Sweswe has ruled out the return of striker, Takesure Chinyama , who despite having been cast out, had expressed optimisim of playing in the team this season. BY TERRY MADYAUTA Chinyama had a tough season last term after joining the club mid-way through the season, where he struggled for game time and only managed one goal in all the matches that he featured in. He was offloaded by the Castle Lager Premier Soccer League champions, but the 35-year old still believes that there is a way back for him despite the club having acquired the services of Farai Mupasiri, Cameroonian import Albert Eonde and Zambian Shadreck Mayembe who have been roped in to try and improve the teams goals tally. “I still want to play, my hope is that I will retain my place in the squad,” Chinyama said. “I enjoyed my stay at FC Platinum and I would certainly want to continue donning the team’s jersey this season. But it all rests in the teams’ management, whether they will give me another chance.” However Sweswe told NewsDaySport that Chinyama is no longer part of their plans. “He is no longer in our plans and it’s been quite a time without him since last season. I don’t know about his contracts but he hasn’t been with us. “We are continuing with the team that played in the champions’ league and we hope that it will retain the title because the club executive wants nothing less than the championship. “There is high morale in the camp and with this crop of players, I hope we will achieve all our objectives,” said Sweswe.
