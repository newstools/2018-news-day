A CONTINGENT of local artistes, who recently performed at the Health Conversation Poetry in Geneva Switzerland, said the musical production they presented was groundbreaking and brought locals to the global stage. BY SHARON SIBINDI Poets Albert Nyathi and Daniel Low-Beer alongside musician Dereck Mpofu performed at the World Health Organisation organised event. In an interview with NewsDay Life & Style, Mpofu said the tour was an eye-opener and their production was appreciated by guests. “We were part of the World Health Organisation annual retreat with about 80 and other top officials,” he said. “We presented on strategies and how we will effectively use them in bringing health related issues to community conversations in our country.
“We presented a musical production on conversation looking at HIV and Aids, TB, malaria and many more. “We did three methods on communicating health issues, which include talking to people, poetry and music.” Mpofu said the response was overwhelming after their production. “We got a good response and it was good for us and almost everyone wants to engage with us in their productions,” he said. Nyathi shared similar sentiments, describing the tour as amazing. “This was absolutely amazing, we set the house on fire,” he enthused. “I saw everyone virtually dancing to music and listening very attentively to the poetry delivered. “The programme was a success and continues to open seemingly endless doors, especially for young Dereck, there are many doors that have opened. “As an artist, you always measure the growth of your business by the amount of doors that open each time you make a presentation.” The event was organised by the communicable diseases cluster aimed at delivering a communicable diseases agenda in alignment with United Health Care and General Programme of Work (2019-2023) for achieving impact at country level.
