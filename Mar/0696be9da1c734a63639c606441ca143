FC PLATINUM interim coach, Lizwe Sweswe believes that their experience in the Caf Champions League, though it was only for two matches, will help them in their bid to defend their Castle Lager Premier Soccer League title.
Sweswe leads FC Platinum in their first match of the season when they take on Yadah in a match they are confident of taking all three points. BY TERRY MADYAUTA The former Tsholotsho coach is holding fort for Norman Mapeza, who is on sick leave after a back surgery following an injury in the gym. “We can say this is our first game, but remember, we have been competing in the Champions League and I believe the experience we got from the African safari will help us on the local front,” Sweswe said. “I think by now, we are more prepared in all departments of the team and the boys are ready to defend their title.
“Yadah is a good side, but we cannot afford to lose against them. We are playing for nothing less than three points and these first games are equally important, so we need to grind results. “Our target is to win the league title again and from the assessment, I think we are ready to defend what is ours but we will take each game as it comes. I am also glad that new players, the likes of Farai Mupasiri, are gelling up well with the rest of the team.” The Platinum miners did not play what should have been their season opener against ZPC Kariba after the latter failed to pitch up for the match, which was scheduled for the National Sports Stadium. The two highly-rated foreign strikers, Cameroonian Albert Eonde and Zambian Shadreck Mayembe, are expected to get their league debut today. On the other hand, Yadah Stars will go into the game looking for another positive outcome following their 2-2 draw with newboys Bulawayo Chiefs.
