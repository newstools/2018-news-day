ZVISHAVANE dance group — Born to Dance (B2D) — known for doing cover videos — have released another video for gospel musician Mpostori Wency’s Nguva Yekutenda.
The video was shot at Shabanie Mine dump and shows the five-member group clad in white regalia and with members performing the beria dance fused with other trending dance moves. BY SHARON SIBINDI Group leader, Obey Kanjera (24) told NewsDay Life & Style that they did the video from scratch, as it only had a live recording. “This time, we decided to do a video cover on Mpostori Wency’s live DVD. We did the whole choreography from scratch fusing in some common apostolic sect’s dances. We thought of showcasing the apostolic sect dances in the video and we did some of the dances like beria, which is common,” he said. Kanjera said they chose to shoot the video at the Shabanie mine dump, as it was a beautiful place. He said they presented the video to Mpostori Wency and he liked it and they were doing the covers to market their dance group. “He liked the video and said he is going to post something on his Facebook page  today (yesterday) that is where we will get his reaction to the video. We are doing it to market our group. We are not being paid,” he said. The group members are Benjamin Sayirai, Vongai Njovo, Brighton Sangu and Tinotenda Madzingaidzo. B2D recently threw their debut salvo with cover version recordings of Sandra “Sandy” Ndebele’s Tshibilika and Selmor Mtukudzi’s Hangasa, which trended on social media platforms and on Monday, the group dropped Mpostori Wency video dance cover.
