Last year the Zimbabwe robotics team participated in the First Global Robotics Challenge in Washington DC and created a robot that could pick out a certain type of trash from a water source. “After receiving training at the Zimbabwe Centre of High Performance Computing based at the University of Zimbabwe, the team was in the top 20 out of over 100 participating nations including Russia and South Africa,” he said. “Even though only five of the 15 members took part due to financial challenges they showed that even though we are a developing nation the passion and capacity for technology is undeniable.” First Global is an organisation that holds yearly international robotics challenge to ignite a passion for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (Stem) among the more than two billion youth across the world to learn the skills they will need to make scientific discoveries.
