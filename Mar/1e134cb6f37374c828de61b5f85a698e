A BULAWAYO Labour Court accounting assistant, who was dragged to court for allegedly defrauding the Judiciary Service Commission (JSC) of over $17 000, has been granted $300 bail. BY SILAS NKALA Abraham Mpofu (32), who was stationed at the Tredgold Building, pleaded not guilty to the fraud charge when he appeared before Bulawayo magistrate Sithembiso Ncube, who remanded him out of custody to March 14. The court heard that Mpofu’s duties included receipting money from clients, banking and recording daily transactions in the cash book. It is the State’s case that on September 20 last year the JSC chief accountant Naison Mudekunye (46), stationed in Harare, in the company of Muchaneta Bongomwe as well as Evidence Chikuni, visited Bulawayo Labour Court for an audit and they allegedly discovered that the receipts in the files did not tally with the carbon copies. Mpofu is alleged to have misrepresented and altered the carbon copies by reducing the amounts, prejudicing the JSC of $17 350,10. Nothing was recovered. A report made to the police led to Mpofu’s arrest.
