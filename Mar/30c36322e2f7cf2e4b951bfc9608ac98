CASTLE Lager Premier Soccer League debutants Nichrut FC head coach John Nyikadzino says the Shurugwi community should not expect too much from the team, as they make their bow into the top flight, claiming their priority this term is to avoid relegation. BY TERRY MADYAUTA There would be easing into life for them into the league, as they play league returnees Mutare City in their opening match next week, a match which on paper, shouldn’t give them headaches. Nyikadzino, who is no stranger to Premiership football, having been at the helm of Chapungu for three seasons, says he has assembled a strong side that should be able to withstand the heat. Some of the big names in the team are former Dynamos midfielder Farai Vimisayi and former Caps United utility player Asani Nhongo. “It’s not going to be easy, but I have been there before and I know what to expect. The main objective is to avoid relegation,” Nyikadzino said. He is not underrating City. “They were also promoted last year and for a team to be playing in the topflight, it means they are a strong side. We are confident that it is going to be a fruitful Premier Soccer League journey and we hope to become seasoned campaigners.” MaShurugwi, as Nichrut is fondly known by the locals, is likely to use Mandava Stadium in Zvishavane, as their base Ascot, which they had registered as their preferred home ground, was condemned by the PSL.
