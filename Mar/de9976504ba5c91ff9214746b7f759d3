DANCEHALL sensation Winky D’s latest video Ngirozi off his latest album, Gombwe, featuring gospel outfit Vabati VaJehova has been met with mixed reactions with critics arguing that he lacked creativity for an artiste of his stature. BY ANESU MUSHAWATU Following the popularity of the track, there was high excitement and anticipation that the video would be from the top drawer. According to public views trending on Facebook, YouTube, Instagram and WhatsApp, the Gaffa and his producers — Nafuna TV — could have done a better job. The general sentiment was that the video did not really demonstrate the angelic ministration sang about as well as the difficulties faced by the featured couple’s children in the Diaspora. It looks like the video was rushed as the Winky D team sought to meet fans’ demands, especially after the Disappear video was produced last year long after the song had stopped trending. It would appear featuring comedian Gonyeti in the video did not sit well with many fans who felt a fresh face could probably have given the it a cutting edge while Winky D looks withdrawn. There was also a feeling that the featured couple did not demonstrate real pain that necessitated consulting mapostori. The producers should however be commended for their creativity in terms of the graphic work in the video. Fans encouraged Winky D to take some lessons from Jah Prayzah whose videos carry an international flavour and a high level of innovation and creativity.
