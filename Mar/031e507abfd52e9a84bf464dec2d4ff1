BULAWAYO was brought to life on Saturday afternoon through vintage performances by local gospel artistes, who set ablaze the fully-packed Bulawayo Theatre during Thembinkosi Nyoni’s live DVD recording concert. BY SHARON SIBINDI The concert, which was dubbed In His Praises Encounter 1 with Thembinkosi Nyoni, brought Christians together. The concert saw various artistes including Oscar, Taliah, Siza, Lantong, Yolanda and Gospel Maniacs mesmerising the crowd. Nyoni, clad in all-white attire, staged an extraordinary performance singing 10 songs from his three albums. The audience danced and sang along to some of his tracks including UmuJehova, Wakamurena, UyiNkosi Yamakhosi and Zincane Izibongo. Nyoni told NewsDay Life & Style on the sidelines of the show that he was excited to see such a crowd. “I was not expecting such a crowd honestly, but just to be trusted by the few for a start it gives a lot of confidence to carry on,” he said. “This event has become an eye opener to me and others as I learnt so much mainly to prepare everything before time. Looking at concert performance we still have to continue working harder and soon am gearing up of part two, which will be epic in everything.” Meanwhile, Harvest House International Church presented the pre-Easter Praise Concert and they launched their new Harvest House International Bulawayo City Hub 2 with Sbunoah of Joyous Celebration. The event featured Vocal Ex, Nceku, Abigail Mwembe, Snowy, Lorraine Stot, Gospel Unplugged, Crème Voices, Carlos Jiri, Tehilla, True Love Choir and One Spirit.
