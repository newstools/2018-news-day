PROPHETIC Healing and Deliverance (PHD) Ministries founder, Walter Magaya and his company Planet Africa have put up $1 million for the top prize in a new talent search show. BY WINSTONE ANTONIO The auditions for the inaugural African Talent Show, to be run through Magaya’s Yadah Television, are set for this Saturday from 7am to 12 midnight at his hotel in Waterfalls, Harare. The auditions will then spread to other parts of the country and beyond the borders. “African Talent Show seeks to identify and promote hidden African talent. We must start with singing and dancing, then we go to other talents. It must not only be for Zimbabwean participants, it is supposed to be African participants,” Magaya says in a promotional video. “It is not my money that I will be using. The partners that I have secured said whoever wins the competition will get a million.” According to a promotional video of the talent show, auditions for the first season of the show will later be beamed live on Yadah Television and DStv channel 281 every Tuesday and Thursday starting in June.
