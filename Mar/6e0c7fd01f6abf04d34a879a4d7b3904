According to Pindula -Mutinhiri started his political career during the days of the Second Chimurenga in the then Rhodesia. This he did through joining the Zimbabwe African People’s Union (ZAPU) and was subsequently attested into the military wing of the revolutionary movement (ZIPRA). In fact, Mutinhiri was one of the founder members of the ZAPU party and its military wing ZIPRA. He rose through the ranks to become one of the most successful military leaders during the liberation struggle. 4.
As early as 2014 Ambrose had started to show his ambitions for the second highest post of the land.  Mutinhiri, arguing why he was suitable to replace the late VP John Nkomo, said qualified for the position. Mutinhiri’s claimed he was the most senior person from former ZAPU members.
