Kenyan opposition leader Raila Odinga has told a UK broadcaster his coalition is considering legal action against Facebook. BBC Speaking to Channel 4 News, Mr Odinga accused the social media giant of “co-operating” with groups like Cambridge Analytica – the scandal-hit company used by his rival, Uhuru Kenyatta. The group, which is accused of exploiting the data of millions of Facebook users, worked for current President Kenyatta in both the 2013 and 2017 elections. Mr Odinga said the experience Cambridge Analytica had gathered between the two dates had allowed them to “perfect” their approach. He described some of the methods used as “devilish”. Mr Odinga said he and his colleagues were “contemplating” suing both groups for the role they played in last year’s election – but that any legal action would take place outside of Kenya. Facebook had previously apologised for failing to protect users’ data. It’s still unclear exactly what role Cambridge Analytica or Facebook played in the Kenyan elections.
