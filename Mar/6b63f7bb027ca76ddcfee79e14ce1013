BULAWAYO city councillors have launched various infrastructure development projects, including roads rehabilitation, using the 3% retention fund from the local authority. BY SHARON SIBINDI Council recently allowed each ward to retain 3% of its monthly rates revenue collection to fund developmental programmes in their localities. Ward 1 councillor, Mlandu Ncube said: “As ward 1, we are utilising our 3% retention fund, as we have repaired pavements, which were in a dire state. Most of our pavements had potholes, which made it hard for businesses to operate. BCC had engaged 12 community workers, who were resealing slabs between 4th Street and Herbert Chitepo Street, 10th Avenue and in front of Pick n Pay Hyper. “Now, we are on tenders and some of them include the renovation of council flats like Jabulani flats.” Ward 4 councillor, Silas Chigora said they had used their allocation for street lighting and grass-cutting along the Bulawayo-Gwanda Road. “We are cutting grass and we have done that along 12 Avenue, and other areas. We also want to do overlaying of roads and our main target is Leeside. We want to put street lights in all major roads. We will choose three roads per suburb, which will get the lights,” he said. Ward 28 councillor, Collet Ndhlovu said the ward was reserving its allocation for construction of a clinic. “We got nothing so far. We want to build a clinic for the ward, but until now, it’s quiet. We wrote a letter last year in June requesting for $75 000, but still now we have not got anything,” he said.
