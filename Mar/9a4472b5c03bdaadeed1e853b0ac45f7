SEVERAL female entertainers yesterday walked away with prizes after they were rewarded for their efforts at the Women’s Business and Leadership Awards ceremony held at a Harare hotel. BY TAFADZWA KACHIKO Musicians Thamsanqa “Tamy” Moyo and Anesu Ketahle Dawani — popularly known as Tahle weDzinza — together with comedian Felistas “Mai Titi” Murata had their work recognised among prominent businesswomen and leaders. Tahle was honoured with the Top Female Arts, Culture and Musicology Artiste of the Year in Special recognition in arts culture and music excellence, while Tammy received the Top Female Artiste of the Year Award.  Comedy sensation, Mai Titi clinched the Top Female Entertainment and Social Media Enterprise Business Leader of the Year Award.
An ecstatic, Tahle said: “This actually came as a surprise. This is really significant because if shows that women in other spheres of life are teaming up to support each other. My industry is one of the hardest because of the stigma that surrounds women in that profession.” The musician said the award was confidence-inspiring and demonstrated that women in music were also important. “Getting this award makes me more confident that women in music will be highly regarded like those practising law as well as chartered accountants. They will be seen on the same footing,” she said, adding that her mother played a critical role in her development as a musician. Mai Titi said she was charmed by the recognition. “I still can’t believe because I never knew that what I am doing is making such a great impact in our nation. Honestly, I am still in shock. It’s means a lot to me, my family, friends and everyone else who supports me. I just want to thank God for this,” she said. Teenage sensation Tammy said the award was a reminder that hard work paid after having put in “all the sweat” into her craft. ZiFM Stereo’s chief executive officer, Susan Makore, and businessman Chamu Chiwanza also clinched awards.
