THE SUSPECTED robbers, who raided a Mpopoma house wielding knives and machetes, where they stabbed a female occupant while demanding cash and killed a neighbour, who tried to rescue their first victim are still languishing in remand prison since their arrest in November last year. BY SILAS NKALA Moses Ncube and Walter Moyo appeared before Bulawayo magistrate Franklin Mkhwananzi on Thursday and were further remanded in custody to March 26 pending their transfer to the High Court for trial. The two are alleged to have killed Siamubine Munkulu when he tried to rescue his neighbour, Marian Kajewe, whom they wanted to rob of cash. The court heard that on November 14 last year, the two met at a house in Mpopoma, where they connived to rob a neighbouring house after they got information that Kajewe (29), who is employed by a bus company, had $2 000 in her room.
Ncube, Moyo, together with Mandlenkosi Thobekani Moyo (27) who is still at large, went to the house on November 15 armed with machetes and knives, scaled over the security wall and broke into the house, Upon realising there were intruders, Kajewe screamed and they stabbed her twice on her right shoulder and once on the abdomen demanding cash. Kajewe surrendered $60 to the robbers. Munkuli (39) heard his neighbourâ€™s screams and rushed to the room. The suspects, who were intercepted by Munkuli, as they made their escape, struck him with a machete on the back of his neck several times. Munkuli collapsed on the spot and was rushed to Mpilo Central Hospital but he died on arrival at the health institution.
