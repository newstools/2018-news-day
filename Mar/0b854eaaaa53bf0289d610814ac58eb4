NATIONAL Aids Council has roped in Ndolwane Super Sounds — which is fronted by Martin Sibanda — for a cancer awareness gig in Tsholotsho’s Tshefunye areas aimed at encouraging the people to go for screening. BY SHARON SIBINDI Sibanda’s manager, Thandazani Nyoni, told Southern Eye that apart from entertaining people, the show was also aimed at encouraging people to be screened for cancer on the day. “We have been working with NAC since 2014 and this time we have decided to embark the cancer campaign with them in Tsholotsho.  We discussed early this year about our relationship with them and what we can do for the community,” he said. “We then decided on the cancer campaign and when we go out there it is serious business. We don’t just make people dance, but we select songs which touch people’s lives and are relevant with the situation on the ground and the campaigns.” Nyoni said they had no new songs but people should watch out for their new dance routines. “The theme of the campaign is about cancer awareness, especially  cervical, breast and prostate,” he said. “We believe it shall be well if the community allow us to do the mobilisation while the NAC will be on their mission educating people and testing them as well.” An official from NAC said they realised music was strategic in mobilising people and that was why they had decided on the gig. “People will get free access to health testing and we will be testing for cancers as well as HIV. We believe that in every 300 people at the show, 100 can always come and get tested. Our wish is that more people should come and get tested and together we can help prevent this killer disease (cancer),” he said.
The event will also be graced by Clement Magwaza of the Makokotsha fame.
