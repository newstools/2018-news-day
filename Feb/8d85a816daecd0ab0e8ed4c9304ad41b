ZPC Kariba coach Godfrey Tamirepi has made wholesale changes to his squad ahead of the 2018 Castle Lager Premier Soccer League season. BY TERRY MADYAUTA After Sunday Chidzambwa’s poor show in charge of the Kariba outfit last season, the club executive moved to restore Tamirepi, who was  sacked together with Saul Chaminuka in 2015.
Now at the helm, Tamirepi is adding depth by acquiring experienced players. ZPC Kariba have made 14 signings which makes them one of the busiest sides in the transfer market as they seek a fresh start having also lost some players. The Kariba-based outfit has welcomed the return of goalkeeper Takabva Mawaya, whose departure from Ngezi Platinum was triggered by the arrival of Donovan Bernard. Pride Tafirenyika and Tendai Tsepo Ranthokwane also reunited with their former mentor. “We have recruited 14 players whom we want to infuse into the squad that is already there. It’s a big task ahead of me, but I hope that these players will help us bring glory to Kariba. “We welcomed back Takabva Mawaya, Tendai Tsepo Ranthokwane and Pride Tafirenyika. We want these guys to come in with the experience they have amassed and add depth to this squad. “Some of these players are coming from Division One mainly Southern Region, but I am not looking at individual players because it’s going to be a collective effort,” he said. Notable among the new signings are Moses Demera formerly of Yadah Stars, Ian Nekati, who joined from FC Platinum, and Simbarashe Gorogodyo who was with Dynamos. Their technical department was also overhauled with Chengerai Dube coming in as the goal keepers’ coach while Kennedy Nagoli was appointed as the team manager and Emmanuel Gutu took over as assistant coach. Newton Chitewe will be in charge of the juniors. However, ZPC Kariba also lost Raphael Manuvire to Dynamos, Never Tigere to FC Platinum while Arnold Chivheya’s contract was not renewed.
