A 61-YEAR-OLD Harare pastor drowned in Biri Dam in Chinhoyi after his boat capsized when it was hit by waves on Monday. BY KINGTON MUNDONDO The body of Hama Blessing Chesa, of Eastlea Tabernacle, Harare, was only retrieved on Tuesday after a long search by members of the police sub-aqua unit, who were called to the scene after the accident. Mashonaland West police spokesperson, Inspector Clemency Mabgweazara confirmed the incident. He said Chesa’s boat capsized after it was hit by a wave, as he was going after a fishing rod thrown by a friend. Two of the cleric’s colleagues managed to swim to safety. Witnesses said Chesa was initially suspended on a tree, which later broke and he fell into the water. Rayfun Kadiwa, a church elder, said the  church had been robbed of a dedicated leader. Mourners are gathered at 1108 Fraser West Road, Parktown, in Waterfalls, Harare. Burial has been slated for Saturday at Glen Forest Cemetery. Chesa is survived by his wife Pelargia, eight children and 12 grandchildren.
