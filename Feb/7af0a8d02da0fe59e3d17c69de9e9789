UPCOMING rap artiste Wellington “Masta” Mutigwa sings against abuse of the girl-child in his recently released album, July the 16th, which is titled in honour of his birthday. BY TAFADZWA KACHIKO Masta, who released the album last week, said he named it after his birth date to celebrate his life, which he said had not been an easy journey. “I named it that to look at my life struggles since day one. Memories, for example, is a song that speaks about how difficult life became, following the death of my father when I was still a little boy,” he said. The 2017 Marondera Music Awards Best rap artiste was born on July 16, 1995, but decided to release the album before his birthday to give his fans time to sample it and understand him better. Masta also condemns abuse of the girl child in the track, Gal Child. “This song is about a disheartening incident I witnessed when I was 18. A 13-year-old girl from our neighbourhood was raped by her step father.
Girl child abuse has always been a vice in our society and it’s increasing in remote areas,” he said. Other songs on the seven-track album are Tsika Nditsikewo, Vavengi Ava, Changamire, Hepi Yepa Jecha and Confession. Tsika Nditsikewo is a praise song dedicated to those who supported him as he grew up. Vavengi Ava brings memories of people who betrayed him. Masta said the music would soon be available on sites such as Reverberation, Soundcloud and Amazon.
