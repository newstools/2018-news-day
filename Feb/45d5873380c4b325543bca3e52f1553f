RENOWNED gospel musician Togarepi Chivaviro has attracted a South Africa-based promoter, who has agreed to a deal of marketing the musician’s songs as well as securing live shows in the neighbouring country. BY LIFE & STYLE REPORTER The musician, who is currently on top of the game with his latest album Matishamisa Jireh, commands a huge following in Zimbabwe, as compared to South Africa where he is based and this has driven Brighton Songore of Songs Construction to craft a deal expected to help increase Chivaviro’s visibility across the Limpopo. The construction company based in South Africa said they were inspired by Chivaviro’s track, Hande Tinovaka, off his latest album, hence, the idea of partnering the musician and promoting both his music and their business. Songore confirmed the development: “It is a blessing to Zimbabweans in South Africa who hunger for gospel music because we will be bringing top musicians like him (Chivaviro). As a construction company based in South Africa, we thought it wise to partner with Chivaviro and we are going to move around with him in South Africa so as to reach out to many people,” he said. Chivaviro hailed the move and said he expected more such partnerships in Mzansi. “We thank God if we have the corporate world responding to our work, especially with Zimbabweans this side. We have been anticipating such a move by the corporate world so that we reach out to all the fans scattered across South Africa. We cannot do it on our own because we have a lot in our hands,” he said. Meanwhile, all is set for Chivaviro’s second album launch to be held at Germistone Prayer Centre on Saturday. The launch follows another one held in Harare last month before the United Kingdom one to be held next month.
