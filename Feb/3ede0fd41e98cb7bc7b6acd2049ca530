HIGHLANDERS coach Madinda Ndlovu — who has assembled a youthful squad ahead of the 2018 Castle Lager Premier Soccer League season, is on the prowl for an experienced striker. BY FORTUNE MBELE Adressing the media at his weekly Press conference yesterday, Ndlovu said the club leadership had been informed of the need to bring in a striker before the season commences. “From the analysis that we have done of the squad that we have, we have made it clear to our bosses that we think we have a grey area which we still need to work on. Funds permitting, it would be advisable for us to deal with that before the window closes, but if funds don’t permit then we have to look at how the boys in camp are faring until the next window period. The team now only needs a seasoned striker, a goal-getter, someone who can bang in goals. That is where my worry is at the moment otherwise in all other areas I am fine,” Ndlovu said. The strikers in Bosso’s ranks so far include Gabriel Nyoni, Godfrey Makaruse and Ray Lunga who played in last year’s team, coached by Dutchman Erol Akbay . Ralph Matema and Nhlanhla Ndlovu’s contracts were not renewed following their expiry on December 31. Chief executive officer Nhlanhla Dube said they had given the technical team the greenlight to look for the striker. “We have said they should look at that and then recommend on the basis of what they see as available out there in the market taking into consideration the financial implications. We will do our best to make sure we answer that call. Strikers of course come at a premium, but we will try everything possible to secure that for them (the coaches),” Dube said. Ndlovu said they had signed two of the three players that he invited for trials last week. The three players that were invited are attacking midfielders Munyaradzi Chitambwe and Nigel Mukombe and defender MacClive Phiri, but he did not say which one they had opted not to take on board.
