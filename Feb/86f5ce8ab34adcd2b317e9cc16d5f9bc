FOLLOWERS of local television look back with nostalgia to the 1990s, the golden era of television which saw the production of local blockbusters such as Neria, Paraffin and Mukadota. BY ANESU MUSHAWATU The local film industry has, however, faced a lot of challenges that have affected production in the last few years.
But despite this grim backdrop, film producer and script writer, Beauty Nakai Tsuro, has defied the odds, with her latest production — a hilarious television series, Statement — set to premiere on ZBC-TV in April this year. Tsuro said she had been able to jump over the hurdles because she was passionate about her work. “The industry has been suffocating from under funding for decades, but what keeps the industry going is the heartfelt passion in the hearts of the arts and culture practitioners to produce good works,” she said through her manager. She said her latest production, Statements, was inspired by the need to uncover the vices that bedevil believers in their walk of faith. “Statements, produced in collaboration with  Snap Media Solutions, brings to attention societal issues that affect the daily lives of people with emphasis on the battles  faced by Christians  in overcoming  life’ s challenges,” she said.
Actor-cum-author, Tendai Maduwa, plays Patrick, a filthy rich businessman married to Patricia (played Kudzai Giji), but is engaged in extra marital affairs. “Patrick has a side chick called Stella, a very controversial and up-class dealer. In the process of officiating the relationship, he stirs daily violence in his romantic life,” Maduwa said. He said the series explored themes of deception, lies, romance and religion. Tsuro has worked on several other productions including Mwanasikana — a two-time National Arts Merit Award nominee — The Long Night and Love Like This.
