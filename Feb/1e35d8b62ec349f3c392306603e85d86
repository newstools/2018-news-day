First Lady Auxillia Mnangagwa has challenged female journalists to ensure women empowerment issues in all sectors of the economy remain on the national agenda. By Staff Reporter Addressing female journalists at State House in Harare yesterday, Auxillia challenged the scribes to fight for their cause. The meeting was meant to address issues affecting women in media and prepare them for life after journalism. “Feel free to approach me so we share notes. Bring ideas that have the potential to uplift women in our society,” she said. Auxillia described media as a powerful tool and should be used for empowerment as “we take the nation forward”. “As women in media, I am challenging you to take it upon yourselves to ensure the agenda of women empowerment remains on course. You have the tools, the voice, and to some extent you have the power, we can only win if we join hands and work as a team.  We are together, we are women and we can only succeed if we work as a team,” she said. The First Lady encouraged women to take up leadership roles and scale the corporate ladder. She also urged female journalists to tell positive stories about other women’s achievements. Also in attendance was TelOne boss Chipo Mutasa and CBZ business banking divisional director Molly Dingane. Mutasa encouraged women to have strong personal values and be passionate about personal development. Dingane urged female scribes to take advantage of empowerment initiatives, such as Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe entrepreneurship loans, set up by the government to capacitate women as they plan for retirement.
