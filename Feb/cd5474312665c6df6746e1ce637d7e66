The court heard that on a date unknown to the prosecutor, but in September last year, the complainant was at home alone when Gapiti invited her to his apartment purportedly for a prayer session.
He later raped her and bought her silence with 25 cents. Using the same modus operandi, Gapiti raped the complainant on two more occasions and gave her 50 cents on each occasion to conceal the abuse. On the fourth occasion, Gapiti and the complainant were spotted by a whistleblower while leaving a disused building near the house.
