GOSPEL songbird Nyasha Mutonhori has opened up on her heavy schedule for 2018, which will see her releasing a new single and doing a live DVD recording this month. BY ANESU MUSHAWATU The single was produced by her husband, Wisdom “Wizee” Nyaparami of Limitless Production. The Best Female Artiste nominee at the PERMICAN awards in 2016 said she decided to start off the year on a high note. Mutonhori said the single, Muneni, was an expression of her gratitude to God. “In this song, I am just being grateful to God for taking care of me through every stage of my life and it is a contemporary gospel song coming out in two weeks’ time and I am dropping it with a video,” she said. Mutonhori told NewsDay Life & Style that Muneni features Victor, a keyboardist originally from the Democratic Republic of Congo, who is now part of her band. She said she roped in Victor as part of an experiment she believed would pay off. “I like to try new things and this is just the beginning. This year expect new things,” she said. The gospel artiste said plans are underway to release another single in April, which she did in South Africa after invitations by renowned South African gospel artistes Nqubeko Mbatha and Ntokozo Mbambo. Mutonhori has worked with several top gospel acts in the country including Mupostori Wency and Mathias Mhere, but her long-cherished dream was to work with regional and international gospel artistes. Her debut album, Garai Mumoyo, was launched in Harare in 2016 and had a number of hit tracks including Huyai Jesu, Haakanganwe and Garai Mumoyo.
