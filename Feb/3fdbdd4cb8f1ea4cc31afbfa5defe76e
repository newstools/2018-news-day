MUTARE City Council has resolved to rope in the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (Zacc) to investigate Mutasa South legislator Irene Zindi (Zanu PF) for allegedly grabbing a council house and fraudulently registering it in her name. BY KENNETH NYANGANI Zindi reportedly occupied the house when she was part of a commission running the affairs of Mutare City Council after the disbandment of the MDC-T-controlled council led by the late Misheck Kagurabadza a few years ago. The matter came out at a full council meeting yesterday in Mutare where councillor Crispen Dube requested to see the copy of the letter set to be handed to Zacc before saying that she should have been involved in the drafting of the letter. This was, however, shot down by town clerk Joshua Maligwa who said that the drafting of such letters was the prerogative of council administrators. “I am hearing you well, councillor (Crispen Dube), the issue of a resolution belongs to councillors, but the drafting aspect belongs to the management, we have lawyers, that is their duty, if we say councillors should also draft the letter, that goes to Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission even in our day-to-day affairs as we will end up confusing each other and we will give you a copy as we have drafted one,’’ he said. A council source told NewsDay that the councillors were afraid that council officials would prefer weaker charges against Zindi. ‘’We are demanding to see the copy because we fear that council might put weak charges and this will not hold any water if the matter goes to court,’’ he said.
Zindi has already denied the allegations claiming that they were politically motivated.
