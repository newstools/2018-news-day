GOSPEL musician, Thembalami Tagwirei is set to launch his fourth album, The Fight, during a “red carpet” event on February 10 at Celebration Centre. BY PRECIOUS CHIDA The 12-track album carries the songs Sekerera, Sawa, Vhangeri, Dairai, Grace Anthem, Nyasha Dzenyu, Dzingori Nyasha, I’m a Winner, Torumbidza, Kure, I Need You and Usadzikisirwe. Thembalami told NewsDay that the album’s title denoted a spiritual fight. “The fight is not a physical battle, but a spiritual fight from our nature of selfishness and self-seeking desire.  It is easy to live anyhow, but choosing to carry your cross and following Christ is a battle fought every day,” he said. “Today’s world demands spiritual warriors that not only fight for themselves, but for their families and communities.” Thembalami said the album — produced by, Macdonald “Macdee” Chidavaenzi, Tremier Msipa, Adrian Tate and Wisdom Nyapara — was meant to help listeners develop their faith. He said he included a few collaborations on the album, roping in Kenyan songstress, Evelyn Wanjiru on the song Sawa, which is topping the charts on Kenyan radio stations. He has also done a collaboration with Zimpraise choir director, Wellington Kwenda, and Tapiwa Masara on the track, Vhangeri. Tickets for the launch are going for $30 and will include two course dinner plus a gift pack and a photoshoot. Thembalami said the album was inspired by his passion to providing people with a soundtrack that keeps them inspired and encouraged when faced with life’s storms. He has three albums to date, with singles such as Tomurimbidza and Sekerera making waves on the gospel music scene.
