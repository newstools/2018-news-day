AMBITIOUS Eastern Region Division One Soccer League side Green Fuel have appointed former Harare City coach Masimba Dinyero to lead their technical department going into the 2018 season.
The 1989 Soccer Star of the Year emerged as top choice among four coaches who were vying for the job that included Jairos Tapera, Alois Bunjira and Warren Mapanga, who were all interviewed by the club. BY TERRY MADYAUTA Club spokesperson Paul Gukushu confirmed yesterday Dinyero’s appointment as head coach. “I can confirm that veteran coach Masimba Dinyero has been appointed as the head coach of our club, Green Fuel, “ said Gukushu. “He emerged as our top choice among other top coaches who had submitted their CVs. Dinyero is set to begin trials early next week as we look forward to build a strong side for this coming season. We had options to weigh amongst the coaches who had shown interest and Dinyero impressed us.” Eastern Region Division One is likely to be an interesting battle ground this season, with newly-formed Manica Diamond FC making a huge investment as they seek to immediately climb into the top-flight under the guidance of Luke Masomere. Army side Buffaloes, who missed out on promotion as Mutare City, who claimed top spot in the division, are also likely to return a worthy force seeking to claim the league title and the sole promotion ticket. Dinyero coached in the same league when he led Highway, but his top-flight experience might have won him the job.
