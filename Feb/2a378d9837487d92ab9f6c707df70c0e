A 76-YEAR-OLD Wedza man has been sentenced to 45 years in jail for raping his three minor granddaughters early this year. by JAIROS SAUNYAMA The man had 10 years suspended on condition of good behaviour, leaving him with an effective 35-year jail term. The septuagenarian had denied the rape charges, but was convicted due to overwhelming evidence against him. Regional magistrate Clever Tsikwa yesterday sentenced him to nine years on each count. According to court papers, sometime in January, the rapist sexually abused his five-year-old granddaughter and gave her a sweet so she could not disclose the abuse. He later summoned another five-year-old granddaughter to his bedroom before raping her once. He also gave her a sweet and threatened to beat her if she disclosed the matter. Using the same modus operandi, the  elderly man summoned his three-year old granddaughter to his bedroom and raped her before giving her a sweet. The matter only came to light when the infants began experiencing difficulties in walking, after which their grandmother questioned them. They  spilled the beans, leading to the arrest of their grandfather. The victims were medically examined and the results confirmed the abuse. Tariro Shirichena-Chamisa represented the State.
