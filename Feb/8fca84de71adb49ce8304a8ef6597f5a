musician and dancer, Sandra “Sandy” Ndebele, says she is repositioning and rebranding herself to become an artiste relevant internationally, ahead of the release of her video, Lizwile, later this month. BY SHARON SIBINDI The new video features South African kwaito star, Professor. Sandy told NewsDay Life & Style that she did not want to be cocooned in a shell anymore and was breaking new ground. “This year is all about repositioning myself and rebranding into an international star. I don’t want to be a Bulawayo girl or a Zimbabwe girl, but I want to become someone relevant everywhere in the music industry,” she said. Sandy said after the launch of the video on February 14, she will kick off her international tour and start working on collaborations. “My first international video is coming out this month. It is my first international collaboration and I am so happy. I have some more collaborations in the pipeline after this video. This time, I will be going West, East and North Africa. I have something big for my fans,” she said. “This project started last year and six months down the line, I have learnt a lot in terms of my music career. Above all, I have learnt that patience pays,” she said. Lizwile went to number 22 on the iTunes Top 200 Tracks in Australia’s World Chart last year. Sandy also released the hit, Ingoma, featuring Bulawayo’s Afro-pop sensation, Mzoe7 and another, Tshibilika, featuring Afro-house producer and musician, Leeknotic. The development followed Sandy’s signing of a publishing deal with a United States music publishing company, OMG Studios.
