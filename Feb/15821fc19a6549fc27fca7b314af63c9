Sharjah — Zimbabwe all-rounder Sikandar Raza was fined 15% of his match fee and given one demerit point for breaching the International Cricket Council (ICC) code of conduct during the third one-day international (ODI) against Afghanistan in Sharjah on Tuesday. Online The incident occurred in the 23rd over of Zimbabwe’s innings when Raza was given out lbw off the bowling of Afghanistan spinner Rashid Khan for 38. According to the ICC release, Raza subsequently “questioned the umpire’s decision by raising his arms before leaving the crease after a short time”. As a result of his actions, Raza was deemed to have breached Article 2.1.5 of the ICC code of conduct for players and player support personnel, which relates to “showing dissent at an umpire’s decision during an international match”. Since Raza accepted the sanction put forth by match referee Richie Richardson, there will be no need for a formal hearing.
Demerit points stay on a player’s record for a two-year period, after which they are expunged. Afghanistan won the third ODI by six wickets and took a 2-1 lead in the five-match series with two games still to play.
