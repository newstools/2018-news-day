A NEW play capturing former President Robert Mugabe’s ouster from power — Operation Restore Regacy — is set to be staged at Charles Austin Theatre in Masvingo tonight. BY TAFADZWA KACHIKO Playwright Charles Munganasa said his play comically traces Mugabe’s last moments in power and life after he was forced to step down having dominated Zimbabwe’s political space for almost four decades. “The play focuses on the last moments of the Mugabe family, giving an insight into what could have happened at the Blue Roof mansion (the Mugabes residency) during its last days in power,” he said. “While a lot happened in the public eye during Operation Restore Legacy, there is still a mystery as to what really took place at the Blue Roof. People are also eager to know what happened to (former First Lady) Grace Mugabe, specifically her reaction when she learnt that the army had taken over. Did she try to stop Mugabe from resigning?” Munganasa said the mystery will be resolved through the play when it premieres tonight. He said he decided to replace “Legacy” with “Regacy” because that was how Vice-President Constantino Chiwenga pronounced the word, “so as to resonate well with the actual event”. Munganasa said the play had personal resonance for him after he was accused of organising a bus that ferried youth from Masvingo to the Bulawayo rally, where Grace was booed. “The play is surely going to be a rib cracker as season award-winning actor Khetani Banda plays the role of Robert Mugabe, while veteran actress Carol Magen’a plays the insane First Lady. Inasmuch as people hated Grace, she was a comic relief in a way. Week in week out, people had something to say about her,” he said. Ngoni Chinovava, Donovan Takaendesa, Marayane Mtetwa, Farirai Mukumba and Dereck Mapfumo also feature in the play.
