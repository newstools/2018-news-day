THE three sisters who were gunned down in cold blood by a Gweru-based soldier at their family house in Magwegwe Bulawayo, last week, have been laid to rest. BY SHARON SIBINDI Carlos Chapeyama (23) allegedly fatally shot his wife and her two sisters before turning the gun on himself in an attempt to commit suicide. The soldier’s 18-month-old baby escaped with injuries. The three were buried at West Park Cemetery yesterday after a three-hour service at the Roman Catholic Church in Magwegwe. The atmosphere was sombre as multitudes of shocked mourners watched the coffins of the late Archly Phiri (21), Rita Nkomo (23) and Nkosivumile Ncube (16) being lowered into their trio’s last resting place. Also present were soldiers. There was no body viewing and photos taken as per request of the family. Chapeyama is alleged to have had long-standing marital problems with his late wife, Phiri (21), who had since relocated to her parents’ home in New Magwegwe, Bulawayo. Chapeyama randomly opened fire on the three sisters killing them on the spot. His 18-month-child survived with serious gunshot wounds. Chapeyama is being detained under heavy military police guard at Mpilo CentralHospital and his child is admitted at the same hospital
