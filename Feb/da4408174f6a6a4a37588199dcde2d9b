THREE former Zanu PF ministers in the Midlands allegedly linked to the G40 faction have appeared before the party’s disciplinary committee to answer to charges of fanning factionalism, provincial chairman, Daniel Mackenzie Ncube has said. BY STEPHEN CHADENGA Addressing a provincial co-ordinating committee meeting in Gweru last Saturday, Ncube said former Youth, Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment ministers Francis Nhema and Chiratidzo Mabuwa and former Mines deputy minister Fred Moyo appeared before the committee. The verdict of the hearings will be announced before primary elections. Ncube also said former Provincial Affairs minister Jason Machaya would be summoned by the disciplinary committee over similar allegations. “I would want to advise you that Francis Nhema, Chiratidzo Mabuwa and Fred Moyo have appeared before the disciplinary committee to answer to allegations of championing the G40 agenda,” Ncube said. “Their fate will soon be deliberated. Machaya, who is facing similar allegations, will also come for disciplinary hearing.” Meanwhile, Ncube urged party members to desist from settling personal scores ahead of primary elections to be held in few months’ time. He also said members, who had joined the G40 faction, were welcome to rejoin Zanu PF. “All members of the party, who had strayed to G40, must be brought back to the party,” he said. “If there are those that remain adamant, we won’t force them.”
