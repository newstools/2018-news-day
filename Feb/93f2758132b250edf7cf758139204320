AN Alpha Media Holdings (AMH) newspaper vendor, Zephaniah Nhamo, was one of the two people shot and killed by police at Seke Road flyover in Harare Central Police Station on Thursday night. By Staff Reporter Nhamo (64) was travelling from Chitungwiza together with his wife when he was allegedly caught in the crossfire and fatally shot as police were trying to disperse vendors and kombi crews charging towards the charge office. Two people died on the spot and four others were seriously injured while property worth thousands of dollars was destroyed during the clashes which started in the afternoon and ended in the evening. Family spokesperson, Prosper Fabiana, described his uncle as the family’s breadwinner. “After killing our uncle in a ruthless manner, the police have never visited us to pay their condolences, even to apologise. When we went to Harare Central Police Station, they mistreated us. It is sad,” Fabiana said. AMH channel development manager Hatred Mandungumana said: “It is a reckless way of losing life that we are faced with, a sad chapter to us as AMH family, but more so, very sad because this was avoidable. “How does a police officer shoot recklessly like that without due care to human life. We hope the long arm of the law will catch up with the perpetrator. Our heartfelt condolences to the family and fellow workmates. He was a very important and hardworking person in the chain of distribution. We are poorer as a family without Sekuru Nhamo.” Fabiana said funeral arrangements would be announced in due course, as police had not yet released  the deceased’s body. Nhamo is survived by a wife, four children and two grandchildren. AMH are the publishers of NewsDay, The Standard and Zimbabwe Independent.
