NSQS committee representative, Nyasha Mhlanga, told NewsDay yesterday that the event was meant to inspire other schools to register, so they could participate in the prestigious World Series tournament to be held at Pearson Institute of Higher Education in Midrand, South Africa from December 6 to 12 this year. Last year, students from Marist Brothers College won the competition after beating 23 other schools from South Africa, Botswana, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The NSQC is a series of televised quizzes that test high school students’ knowledge of science, maths, African facts, history, literature and general knowledge.
