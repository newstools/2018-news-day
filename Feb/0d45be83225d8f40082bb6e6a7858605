A 63-YEAR-OLD Marange man appeared in court yesterday facing an indecent assault charge after he allegedly caressed the private parts of his brother’s six-year-old daughter. BY KENNETH NYANGANI The accused, from Chikwariro village under Chief Marange, denied the charge when he appeared before Mutare magistrate Tendai Mahwe.
He, however, admitted to fondling the minor’s breasts. It is the State case that sometime in September last year, the accused, taking advantage of the absence of the complainant’s parents, got inside the house and found her sitting on the floor. He allegedly sat next to her and touched her private parts. The complainant then informed her brother who in turn told their mother, leading to the accused’s arrest. The matter was remanded to tomorrow for sentence. Mathew Chimutunga prosecuted.
