They should arrive home either tonight (last night) or early tomorrow). “Given president Tsvangirai’s stature we would have wanted to take him to every town in Zimbabwe. He is the people’s president, a man of the people but it will be a logistical nightmare given the different stakeholders involved including the State. However we are going to have a mass funeral for him in Harare on Sunday but we are still trying to make a decision on the venue. It will either be Rufaro Stadium, National Sports Stadium or Freedom Square (space behind Rainbow Towers in Harare,” said Mwonzora. “Burial will be on Monday in Buhera.”
