SEVERAL gospel outfits from different church denominations attended the inaugural Uniting in Worship Seminar held at The Farmers Hall in Marondera recently. BY JAIROS SAUNYAMA A brainchild of Rutendo Gomba and Liberty Vhazhure of Worship Avenue International, the seminar was meant to empower those involved in worship music with new skills and knowledge. The panellists included renowned musicians Mpostori Wency, Blessing “Bleds” Chimanga and Bulawayo’s Lady Tshawe, who addressed the gospel groups. Top sound engineer Denford Madzika also shared notes on good sound engineering skills. Vhazhure said the seminar was a success and that they were now preparing for the next event to be held next month. “We had an awesome attendance as we attracted teams from over 12 denominations in and around Marondera. The audience was participative and made the interaction at the seminar absolutely interesting. The guest speakers displayed experience in their presentations,” he said. Vazhure said their aim was to improve the standards of gospel music through holding seminars around the country and their next stop would be in Mutare before spreading out to the rest of the country’s provinces. “Worship Avenue is there to build a network and help our teams with workshops as well as trainings to instil skill in the anointed ministers,” he said. The event was also attended by non-singers. Worship Avenue International was formed in January with its main objective being of bringing together worshippers and teaching music groups from various churches on how to present themselves.
