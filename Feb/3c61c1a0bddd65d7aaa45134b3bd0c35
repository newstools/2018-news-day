The was drama at the Harare Magistrates’ Court yesterday when the State backtracked on the agreement they had earlier made with former Tourism minister Walter Mzembi to release his passport to enable him to travel to South Africa for business. BY DESMOND CHINGARANDE Mzembi, who is facing fraud allegations after he was arrested by Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (Zacc) during Operation Restore Legacy last year had appeared before magistrate Rumbidzai Mugwagwa, who remanded the matter to yesterday for ruling. However, before the ruling was delivered, the State advised the court that they wanted to make an application to overturn the passport release consent to allow them to seek consent from Zacc which is handling the matter. Mzembi’s lawyer Job Sikala protested the State’s move and Mugwagwa postponed the matter to next Friday February 16 for ruling. Mzembi is on $400 bail following his arrest on allegations of illegally donating four government-sourced television sets to the United Family International Church, Prophetic Healing and Deliverance Ministries and Zion Christian Church. The TV sets were sourced by the government to promote the country’s bid to host the 2010 World Cup football finals.
Sebastian Mutizirwa appeared for the State.
