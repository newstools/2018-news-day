TOP-FLIGHT returnees Mutare City Rovers could be forced to find an alternative home for the upcoming season, which roars into life early next month, after the Premier Soccer League (PSL) grounds committee condemned Sakubva Stadium. BY KENNETH NYANGANI The grounds committee, led by Zifa officials Willard Manyengavana and Xolisani Gwesela and PSL officer Elisha Mandireva, toured the stadium on Monday and concluded that it needed a major revamp for it to meet the required standards. Concerns were raised over the state of the dressing rooms, turf, drainage system, goalposts, and the tunnels, which they said needed to be renovated. Mutare City Rovers were also instructed to construct a new perimeter wall around the stadium. Mutare City spokesperson Edson Kalulu confirmed they had been told to spruce up the stadium. He, however, said they had started the renovations and were hoping to finish before the start of the season. “The stadium was condemned, but we should be done with the renovations in three weeks’ time. We gave a tender to the Zimbabwe Prisons and Correctional Services who are going to erect the new perimeter wall and work has already started,” Kalulu said. “I don’t think this is going to affect our preparations. In fact, were are ready for the upcoming season,” he said. Calls for the renovation of Sakubva seem to have fallen on deaf ears over the years with Mutare City Council failing to provide funding to give the stadium a facelift. Sources within the council have attributed the council’s failure to renovate the stadium to divisions within the leadership at the local authority.
