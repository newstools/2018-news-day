The government on Wednesday sent a condolence message to the family of Zimbabwe’s ambassador to Angola, Ngoni Francis Sengwe (69), who died on Saturday after a short illness.
In a statement, Chief Secretary to the President and Cabinet Misheck Sibanda said: “Ambassador Sengwe had an illustrious career in the diplomatic fraternity, having risen through the ranks from the post of senior administrative officer in 1981 to his current post of ambassador to Angola. He was instrumental in the establishment of Zimbabwe’s embassy in Germany and co-ordinating the hosting of Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in 1991,” the statement read. By Staff Reporter Sengwe also had short stints at the Zimbabwe mission to the United Nations in New York, Federal Republic of Nigeria and Ghana. “I am particularly saddened that Ambassador Sengwe departed at a critical time when the country is re-orienting its foreign policy towards economic diplomacy, where his experience and institutional memory was greatly needed,” the statement read. “While his loss is certainly irreplaceable, his family may wish to take comfort in the knowledge  that his colleagues in government and indeed the diplomatic community in particular, also grieve with them as they mourn a loving father, devoted husband, grandfather and a family pillar.” Sengwe, who was born on August 14, 1949 in Chikomba, attended Chikore High School before proceeding to Columbia University in South Carolina, US, where he attained Bachelor of Arts and a Master of Arts in International Relations and Communications degrees.
He is survived by his wife Loriat and three children.
