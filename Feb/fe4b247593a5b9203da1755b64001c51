ASPIRING Gweru Urban parliamentary candidate, Trust Chikohora has launched a roads rehabilitation programme targeting pothole-riddled roads in the high-density suburb of Ascot to endear himself with the electorate ahead of general elections later this year. By Stephen Chadenga Chikohora wants to contest the election on a Renewal Democrats of Zimbabwe (RDZ) ticket. The former Common Markets for Eastern and Southern Africa business council secretary-general and Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce president said he took the initiative after residents approached him for help. “Residents’ lives, particularly children, were being put at risk by the straying kombis,” he said “Women, who sell their wares on roadsides in Ascot suburb also said their goods were being destroyed by kombis, as they avoided the huge potholes. I decided to source stones from ZimAlloys and other material before my [team], with the help of the community, patched the potholes.” Chikohora said it was critical for political leaders, both aspiring and current, to attend to real problems in the community affecting people. He said the Gweru municipality, which received funds from the Zimbabwe National Roads Authority, is concentrating on major road networks, hence, there was need for immediate solutions until central government and local authorities have capacity to attend to all the road networks. “In the meantime, there is need for local community solutions,” he said. Chikohora said he had lined up various developmental projects for the constituency, which has been starved of true parliamentary representation for years.
