BY ANESU MUSHAWATU RADIO personality Candice Mwakalyelye and intellectual property expert Tariro Matibiri are set to headline the fourth edition of The Mesh, a platform for constructive dialogue, food and drink. Founder Ralph Kadurira told NewsDay Life & Style that the event would be held at Chez Zandi in Harare on March 3 at 3pm. “The Mesh is an event that seeks to cultivate good networking web for young adults in terms of business and social relations. The mission, really, is to gather leaders, movers and shakers and people from every culture and discipline and make great ideas accessible,” he said. The programme was launched in April last year and has, to date, held three events that have also featured gospel rapper Mudiwa Hood, Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation producer Dumisani Sibanda and South Africa-based author and preacher, Melody Kanguru, as well as television presenter Samantha Sibanda as panellists. The programme, bankrolled by Elevate, Springtide Morphoos and Vine Design, tackles socio-business issues. The forthcoming edition, according to Kadurira, was open to all interested parties upon payment of $5. Entertainment will be provided by Bryan K, Alfred Sax, CCICCI and DJ Tumz.
