THE National Social Security Authority (NSSA) has launched Vision Zero Strategy meant to reduce work-related illnesses, injuries and death at workplaces. BY ALEXIS SIBANDA Speaking at the launch of the programme in Bulawayo yesterday, NSSA chief inspector of factories, Shingirai Marunza, said the target was achievable. “We want everyone to be accountable and responsible with the equipment used at the workplace and make sure to strike a balance such that no one gets injured,” he said. “We have adopted the vision zero strategy since last year and we are now trying to push it within Bulawayo and Zimbabwe at large, because we need everyone to put their efforts and avoid fatalities within the place. “We have got a thrust where we have the support of the government and everyone. We are saying we do not want anyone getting injured and this is the vision that we have. While working, no one should contract a disease and this is a thrust by NSSA,” he added. Maruza said NSSA is facing challenges, such as antiquated laws and lack of leadership commitment from business. “Organisations should embrace their ability of this vision zero and make sure that industries are well-informed about this NSSA stance. Let us move together as a nation and make sure that we reduce these accidents,”  he said. NSSA regional manager, Wellington Chinembiri, said they would embark on vision zero awareness campaigns in all factories and ask for leadership’s commitment to the programme to reduce the number of work-related injuries.
