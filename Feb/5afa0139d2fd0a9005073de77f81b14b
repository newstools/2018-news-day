CAPE TOWN  —  Cape Town City have lacked a creative edge since the departure of Lebogang Manyana and Aubrey Ngoma, but club boss John Comitis believes the signing of Matthew Rusike is the “missing piece in the puzzle”. IOL The Cape club signed the much-travelled Zimbabwean striker shortly before the close of the transfer window on Wednesday night – and, with the team in urgent need of an energetic presence in attack, the 27-year-old is viewed as the player to galvanise things. “Rusike has the right ethos and the right attitude. He has great self-belief and he will get goals for the team. He is the missing piece in our puzzle, especially as Masoud Juma (Kenyan new signing) will need another month to recover from an ankle injury,” he said. Rusike is no stranger to the PSL, having previously spent three years at Kaizer Chiefs (2012-2015), he has played in Sweden for Halmstad and Helsingborgs, and most recently had a stint in Tunisia with Club Africain. The arrival of Rusike concludes City’s January transfer business – the others include defender Kwanda Mngonyama, Ugandan winger Allan Kateregga, midfielder Surprise Ralani and Juma.
