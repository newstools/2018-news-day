Guruve’s Siyalima villagers will soon join the mainstream community in accessing the mobile phone network after Information and Communication Technology (ICT)  minister Supa Mandiwanzira promised a NetOne base station to service the farming community within the next two weeks. BY Everson Mushava The promise was made on Wednesday during a visit by President Emmerson Mnangagwa of the Siyalima irrigation project that services 96 families. Mnangagwa summoned Mandiwanzira to the podium at his inaugural rally since he took over from former President Robert Mugabe last November. “I am told you don’t have mobile network access?” Mnangagwa asked the community. “The ICT minister is here, where is Supa? Come here. Tell us what you are going to do with this problem.” Mandiwanzira said he had consulted NetOne and Telecel and the companies had assured him a base station would be up in 45 days. But Mnangagwa objected, demanding action with immediate results. “We have realised that 45 days is a long period. There is a temporary base station that can be mounted in two weeks while a permanent one is being put up. That is what we have arranged,” Mandiwanzira said, to the excitement of the thousands of supporters. Mnangagwa weighed in: “I don’t appoint silly people as my ministers. He is a clever minister, that is why I appointed him. I want you to be connected so that you talk to people from Australia, Canada, America and all over while you are eating your masawu (wild fruit),” Mnangagwa said. Mnangagwa promised development to the community through modernisation of production and processing of their farm
produce.
