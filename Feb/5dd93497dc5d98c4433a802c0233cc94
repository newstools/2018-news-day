ZIMBABWE Football Association (Zifa) chief executive, Joseph Mamutse yesterday appeared at the Harare Magistrates’ Court yesterday facing contempt of court charges after he allegedly hid the association’s property, which had been attached by the sheriff. BY DESMOND CHINGARANDE Mamutse (58), who pleaded not guilty to the charge when he appeared before magistrate Ruramai Chitumbura, was remanded out of custody to March 5 for trial. According to the court papers, the complainant in the matter is Garikai Mataga, who is employed by the Judicial Service Commission and is based at the High Court of Zimbabwe. It is the State’s case that on July 29, 2016, the High Court of Zimbabwe issued a writ of execution against Zifa’s movable and immovable properties and instructions were given to Daisy’s Guest House representatives to attach the property. The State alleges on June 14 last year, the duty sheriff proceeded to number 160 Enterprise Road, Chisipite, where he attached a Hyundai bus to compensate the money that Zifa had failed to pay Daisy’s Guest House. The State alleges Zifa was given 48 hours to respond to the notice of seizure but failed to do so. On June 19 last year, however, Mataga went to number 160 Enterprise Road, Chisipite, to collect the attached bus, but discovered the vehicle had been removed and moved to an unknown place. It is the State’s case that Mamuste breached the court order with his unlawful actions leading to his arrest.
Peter Kachirika appeared for the State.
