THE much-awaited premier of the 104-minute feature film, Kushata Kwemoyo, initially set for last month, will now be held tomorrow at Ster Kinekor, Eastgate in Harare. BY LIFE & STYLE REPORTER There was controversy after the film, directed by Shem Zemura, was nominated and went on to win the Outstanding Screen Production (Feature Film) at the 17th edition of the National Arts and Merits Awards before its premiere. One of the actors, Charles Muzemba scooped the Outstanding Actor award at the same awards ceremony. In an interview with NewsDay last week, Zemura said the desire to make the event colourful had stalled the premiere. “The film is now ready for screening and we have set Thursday for the grand premiere,” he said. “Our initial plan was to do a normal screening, but we then realised that our audience are not ordinary. “They deserve an exceptional event, so we decided to make it a five-star red carpet event, and that required a lot preparation, hence, the delay.” Kushata Kwemoyo, which explores the subject of bitterness, tells the story of Chiedza, played by Gamuchirai Dube, who is bitter as a victim of abuse. Kudzai Musango, Alaika Bhasikolo and Elijah Madzikatire also feature in the film, which was written by Amanda Ranganawa Zemura, who also worked with her brothers, Nick and Mike, on popular productions, Muzita Rababa and Muchaneta. Zemura said the standard and VIP tickets for the premier are going for $5 and $10, respectively.
