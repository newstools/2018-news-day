CHIEF executive officers (CEOs) will gather in Victoria Falls next month to get skills and knowledge meant to advance economic growth in  Africa. CEO Africa Roundtable chairman Oswell Binha said a high level platform for corporate CEOs and senior executives, in both public and private sector, has been created to advance economic development across Africa.

He said in line with Agenda 2063, as espoused by the African Union, this was a call for action to all segments of African society to work together to build a prosperous and united Africa based on shared values and a common destiny. Binha said the key focus for the CEO Africa Roundtable was to engender long-term economic planning towards co-ordination and harmonisation underpinned by a clear vision and development plan. He said the integrated approach helps nations in the allocation of resources towards implementation of multi-sectoral strategies and setting in motion a series of mutually supporting activities in different sectors with the general objective of delivering economic development, poverty alleviation and creation of integrated communities’ in line with a common national, regional and continental vision.
