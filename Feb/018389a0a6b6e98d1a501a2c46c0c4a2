CAPS United forward Ronald Chitiyo has started light training, having been sidelined after he was involved in a car accident late last year. BY KEVIN MAPASURE Since the Green Machine commenced pre-season training, Chitiyo has been watching from the sidelines after he was advised by doctors to take an extended break. Chitiyo joined his teammates for training at Alexandra Sports Club in Harare yesterday, but was only involved in the lighter drills. His return in a boost to Caps United ahead of the season, although he might miss the initial games of the new season as he regains full fitness. The former Dynamos and Harare City attacker spent the last six months of 2017 in Tunisia where he had joined Club Sportif Staxien, but he has since left the club to return home. Rodreck Mutuma who spent part of last season at Yadah FC also trained with Caps United yesterday, as he seeks to persuade the coaching department to sign him on. Mutuma had a short stint with Caps United in 2016, before he quit the club to rejoin Dynamos. Last year he started the season with Highlanders but left the club during the midseason transfer window to join Yadah FC, following issues to do with remuneration. Yadah owner Prophet Walter Magaya has threatened to withdraw financial support to the club, as he bids to focus on other projects. There has been an air of uncertainty over the future of the club and players have since started to look elsewhere, which also prompted Mutuma to seek audience with Caps United coach Lloyd Chitembwe. Caps United lost striker Dominic Chungwa to South Africa after Abbas Amibu had left the club earlier. Although the Green Machine have since signed Brian Muzondiwa they still have issues in the striking areas as there is a possibility of losing John Zhuwawo, who is wanted by Zambian side Buildcon. Mutuma is likely to get another chance to impress the coaches when Caps United face Highlanders in a pre-season match at the weekend.
