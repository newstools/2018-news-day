AFTER making waves last year with songs featuring Sandra Ndebele and TKP, Leroy “Leeknotic” Mhike has returned with a thrilling track, Kuze Kuyevalwa, featuring contemporary musician Hwabaraty. BY SHARON SIBINDI The Afro dance track comes after the artiste recently released a single, Thanyela, a duet with SkyzMetro FM radio personality Sandisiwe “TKP” Dube.
Kuze Kuyevalwa was co-produced by Jay-Dot and was recently launched on Skyz Metro Vuka Vuka breakfast show. “This is my first track this year and this is just the beginning of greater things we have lined up for this year.  The track is a dance song talking about clubbing till the end. The club is rocking,” Leeknotic said. “It’s all about good vibes and energy this year. This time I have worked with Hwabaraty as he is different from other artistes.  He has a tradition feel. It’s an Afro dance song.” He said working with Hwabaraty was a milestone and he was grateful for the opportunity. Leeknotic, an Afro-house musician and producer, signed under Afro Platinum Music, and Skaiva will have his debut performance at this year’s Gqom festival dubbed Gqom Life Gardens on March 3 hosted by Black Diamond.
