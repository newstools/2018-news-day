GOSPEL musician Mathias Mhere has engaged three local bus companies to play videos from his Old Testament DVD album, as part of an aggressive marketing strategy targeted at the bus enterprises’ customers. BY ANESU MUSHAWATU Mhere told NewsDay yesterday that the deal — struck with Inter Africa, Rimbi Tours and CAG Tours — will also involve the bus crews selling the DVDs at $1 a copy to interested travellers. “We have distributed the DVDs to Inter-Africa, Rimbi Tours and CAG Tours as a way of reaching out to a larger audience,” he said. The gospel musician said the low price was a way of circumventing piracy, as customers would now be able to afford original, high-quality copies of the DVD, which was directed by Willard “Slimaz” Magombedze. The album Old Testament was launched at 7 Arts Theatre in Harare last year and carries popular songs such as Nhamo Yekuzvipa, Dhindindi Fulltime, Mwana WaJesu and Judas Iscariot. Mhere expressed hope that the new strategy would bring positive results and said he was looking at more innovative ways, including street screenings for the DVD to entice more gospel music lovers. Although Mhere initially planned to roll out the campaign in January this year, he was forced to postpone it to this month to allow for the purchasing of flash disks that would be used in the playing of the videos in the buses. In an earlier interview with NewsDay, the musician said although he rated the album as his best to date because of the professional work invested in it, he would leave it to his fans to pass the final verdict. “I will let the fans rate it as they listen. But for me, this is the best because it meets international standards in terms of quality,” he said.
