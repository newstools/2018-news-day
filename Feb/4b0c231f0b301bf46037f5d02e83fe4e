AILING sungura exponent Tedious Matsito has anointed his son, Tedious Muchapedza Matsito (Jnr.), to take over the reins of Ngwenya Brothers, in a move that is meant to keep the band alive. BY JAIROS SAUNYAMA Matsito’s health woes worsened a few weeks ago, after he suffered  another stroke while still recovering from an earlier attack he had in December 2016 when he was in South Africa. The Gede hitmaker is reportedly struggling to speak and has since given a nod to his 16-year old-son to replace him until he recovers. Matsito’s wife, Patience, confirmed the development saying her husband needs enough time to rest, hence the appointment of a new heir who is expected to fill in his father’s big shoes. “My husband needs time to rest and we thought it wise for Muchapedza to take over. He is a great singer and has been moving around with his father for the past two years. “Junior wanted to record a Zimdancehall album, but we had to persuade him to concentrate on Ngwenya Brothers until his father fully recovers,” she said. Muchapedza Junior is set to write his ‘O’ Level examinations this year. He has become the latest son of a living legend, to take over from his father following Potiphar Mopo the son of Mike Mopo who is currently leading ZINAWA band. Matsito last released an album in 2013, before ill-health took toll on him. The mild stroke he suffered affected his speech, thereby, making singing difficult.
