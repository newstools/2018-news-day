JAZZ crooner and Green ambassador Dereck Mpofu has partnered with the Ministry of Environment, Water and Climate to host a Green Valentine’s Dinner at the Mayoral Mansion in Harare tonight to fundraise for the set-up the first ever ECO-HUB in Mutare. BY WINSTONE ANTONIO The dinner will be held under the theme Creating an Environmental Legacy. The Chisikana Changu Zimbabwe hitmaker said the ECO-HUB will help youths to access opportunities in the environmental sector. “With annual expenditure of $234 million, there is still no direct platform for young people to access opportunities on the environmental sector. The centre shall offer different services that will include skills in mushroom production, recycling, tree cultivation funded by micro-finance youth serving organisation,” he said. Mpofu said there was lack of co-ordination within the environmental sector, despite having 185 registered youth-led organisations, five government ministries with the environment as a primary priority and over 20 international development agencies providing support for the environment.
He said the dinner will also be a launch pad for the rollout of the Little Green Ambassadors programme, anchored on a book he authored and a musical CD he recorded with and children from the Grange Christian School. “The Little Green Ambassadors book is meant for primary education in Zimbabwe and it complements the government’s efforts to increase awareness on environment, water and climate issues. We will also fundraise towards the printing of 100 000 Little Green Ambassadors books and CDs,” he said. “The book shall be used as a way to foster environmental and climate change awareness amongst the younger generation between the four to 12 years. The book has already been translated into four languages English, Shona, Ndebele and Tonga,” he said.
