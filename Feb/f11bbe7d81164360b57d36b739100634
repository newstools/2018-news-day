About 224 people died due to electricity mishaps, including Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (Zesa) employees, between 2009 and 2016.
Of these 15 were Zesa employees, while the rest were victims of the power utility’s infrastructure collapse, victims of unsafe practices and thieves attempting to steal copper cables or oils. By Own Correspondent An official of the Zimbabwe Energy Regulatory Authority (Zera), Tobias Mangwiro on Tuesday said 46% of the people killed in electricity mishaps were victims of collapsing infrastructure. “Then we have those killed due to unsafe practices particularly in resettlement areas,” he said. Mangwiro was speaking at a consumer education function in Beitbridge. Some people in resettlement areas independently made electrical installations at times using barbed wire and wet poles. Mangwiro said another 13%, who died were workers unfamiliar with electricity use and used unsafe practices. “The other 7% are thieves trying to steal from our installations,” he said.
