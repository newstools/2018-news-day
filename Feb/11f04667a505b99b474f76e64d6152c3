BUDDING Afrocentric musician Munyaradzi Nyamarebvu has postponed the launch of his debut album, Ngatidanane, initially scheduled for tomorrow to Saturday. BY GARIKAI TUNHIRA The launch will now be held at Pakare Paye Arts Centre in Norton and not at the Zimbabwe German Society as earlier planned. “Kindly be notified that my album launch date and venue have been changed to February 17 at Oliver Mtukudzi’s Pakare Paye Arts Centre Hall owing to the renovations that are currently under way at our initially chosen venue. Any inconveniences caused are sincerely regretted,” said the musician. Nyamarebvu has been touring Europe and the United States between 2014 and 2017. The acoustic 11-track album carries songs that include Ngatidanane (Let’s give peace a chance),a song that resonates with the world peace banner, Yorira Nhare (Mbira Spirit) and Natsa (Lamentations), which exhibit deep cultural nhare mbira rhythms and powerful chants, Mwanangu Mharadzi (Ohh, My Son), Rumurika as well as Zvikoni (Incantation). Ngatidanane also has an official video which was shot and directed in the US during Nyamarebvu’s recent tour there in 2017. The video is scheduled for release soon. “This solo concept is a speciality that has not been experienced in the local music scene for quite some time,” Nyamarebvu said. “With this album, I am slowly orienting and subconsciously saying to the audiences, ‘welcome to my music’ and ‘welcome to my brand’ in an intimate artistic fashion.” A singer-songwriter and mbira player, Nyamarebvu said he had been working on his debut album since 2012, “giving it ample time to evolve”. “I believe that music should unify people and impact positivity, peace and love in the society. Music should touch on critical societal issues and speak for the voiceless as well as reflect culture,” he said.
