MIDLANDS-BASED Premier Soccer League teams, FC Platinum, Shabanie Mine and hosts Chapungu are set to participate in a memorial tournament for veteran Chapungu goal minder Roy Stephen Mazingi at Ascot Stadium. BY TERRY MADYAUTA The tournament, which could also involve newly-promoted Nichrut, has been scheduled for March, 3 a week before the commencement of this year’s edition of the Castle Lager Premier Soccer League. Chapungu official, Group Captain Pasipamire Maketo told NewsDaySport that all the league teams had confirmed their participation in the tournament.
“We wanted to host this tournament earlier on but the teams recommended that we move it to March 3,” she said “We are also expecting one other team to confirm with us between newly promoted Nichrut or Sheasham (a lower league team) to complete the four teams that will take part in the one-day tourney. “The tournament is solely targeted at raising funds to support the family of our late goalkeeper, Roy so all the gate takings will be channelled to the Mazingi family.” Mazingi died on January 11 this year at the age of 31. He spent five years at Chapungu. Before that, Mazingi had played for Shabanie Mine and the now-defunct Lancashire Steel.
