FOUR  New Zealand-based children aim to raise $2 200 when they embark on a 3,7 km  fundraising  fun walk  in support of the Zimbabwe Rural  Schools Library Trust (ZRSLT) in Hamilton on February 24. BY ANESU MUSHAWATU Arlo Oliver, Ropafadzo Kunaka and twin sisters Shefali and Shivhani Sinha have registered to be sponsored for their participation in the fun walk    to raise money that will be used to mobilise educational reading material for their less privileged counterparts in rural Zimbabwe. Now in its fourth year, the fun walk has become an annual event since its initiation by the twins who are anticipating to raise a minimum of $1 000. “Every seemingly little effort provides hope towards a positive future for a deserving child in Zimbabwe,” wrote the twins on their Facebook page. Kunaka said she would not miss the opportunity to help and extended an open invitation to other interested people to support the cause. “I always give a helping hand for a good cause whenever I can and I will not miss an opportunity to contribute in the small way I can towards the well-being of the children in my birth country,” she said. Oliver has also roped in her family to support ZRSLT in shipping books to Zimbabwe and help set up library in the schools which need them. Funds raised through the fun walk in the past have gone towards shipping books from New Zealand to Zimbabwe, purchasing of brand new books published in Zimbabwe and has contributed towards recording of songs promoting learning, reading and use of libraries.
