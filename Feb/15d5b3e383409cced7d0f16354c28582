Telecel Zimbabwe has launched a point-based competition, Bundle Mania Promotion, for registered subscribers who purchase WhatsApp, Facebook, MegaBoost and wi-fi bundles. BY STAFF REPORTER The Bundle Mania promotion, which starts today, will allow Telecel Go Prepaid, Red Hybrid and Red Business Hybrid subscribers to earn points when they purchase bundles through the USSD short code *480#. Subscribers, who purchase any of the participating bundles automatically accrue points, but have to opt-in in order for their points to be used in the random selection based competition. The promotion ends on April 30. Telecel communications and branding director Obert Mandimika said the promotion was the mobile operator’s way of giving back to its loyal subscribers while increasing awareness and usage of the bundles. “On top of wanting to give current bundle users an opportunity to win some of our many prizes, we are also asking those who have not used our bundles to do so and experience our affordable services while also standing a chance to win,” he said. Bundle Mania Promotion points will be accumulated based on the value of the bundle the subscriber purchases. Customers taking part can expect to earn one point for every 50 cents worth of bundles bought, while those spending $50 can expect as much as 100 points. The point based competition gives participants with a greater number of points an increased chance of winning in the random selection based promotion.
