On January 31, 2017, the Health ministry took to microblogging site Twitter to blandly announce a cholera outbreak update which read: “The cumulative figure for suspected cholera cases is now 94, five admitted, six confirmed and deaths remain at four. There is one suspected case in Norton. This case is linked to a funeral that occurred in Chegutu on January 18, 2018.”
