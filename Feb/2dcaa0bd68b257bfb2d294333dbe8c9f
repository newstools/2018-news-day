Bakers Inn says its market share has risen to 45% aided by promotions, which has seen the country’s biggest confectionery maker expand its reach. BY BUSINESS REPORTER The company concluded its last leg of the Buy and Win promotion on Saturday, which management felt has helped to increase consumer uptake. “This is our third year running this promotion. We have seen huge success in terms consumer uptake. It has helped us grow our market share. It has helped us put a distance between ourselves and competition,” Precious Mpofu, Bakers Inn general manager for the northern region said.
“We have grown from about 40% to 45%.” Mpofu said the company was operating at full capacity with volumes of 500 000 loaves per day. Bakers Inn sales and marketing executive, Caleb Musodza said management are grateful for the support it is getting from shareholders in the tough operating environment. He said the promotion has grown over the years with an improvement in the grand prizes over the years. “This is the third edition and the vehicles have moved from a Honda Fit to VW Polo, now we have Mercedes Benz. I think let me leave the imagination for the next promotion to you. You can see how we have grown in terms of our focus in this promotion and I will say for us as management are grateful to our shareholders. In this environment to be allowed to do strategies like this [promotion] to grow the business, to get those resources, we are very grateful,” he said. Bakers Inn financial director, Mandla Nkosi said the promotion was “the only promotion that goes every province”. “We look at that as an investment not as a cost,” he said. Nkosi said no town or customer were too small for the bread maker. “Most promotions happen in Harare or Bulawayo but for us every customer and town is important. In a month, we travel in excess of 1,4 million kilometres distributing the bread,” he said. Musodza said Bakers Inn has a national footprint in terms of bread distribution.
