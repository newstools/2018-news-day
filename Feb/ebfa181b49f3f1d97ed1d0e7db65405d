THE National Arts Council of Zimbabwe (Nacz) has launched the People’s Choice Award nomination platform for the 17th National Arts Merit Awards (Nama). BY ANESU MUSHAWATU The nomination platform will run from February 5 to 17 ahead of the awards night scheduled for February 17 at Reps Theatre in Harare.
The call follows last week’s release of nominees for this year’s edition of Nama. In a statement released yesterday, Nacz deputy director Nicholas Moyo said the award would be given to an artist or art institution that would have attracted the highest number of public votes. “As its custom, Nama affords the opportunity to the public to vote for an artist of their choice in any of the Nama categories,” he said. “To vote for one’s favourite artist for this year’s People’s Choice Award, one has to send the artist’s name to this WhatsApp number +263 772 168 045. The syntax is #ARTIST NAME. The artist with the most votes will be declared a winner and awarded at the awards ceremony.” Last year’s People Choice Award was won by Winky D. The awards ceremony will be televised live on ZTV and streamed on several Facebook pages linked to the council’s official page, Nacz Nama page. The Nama submissions were closed on November 30 last year after which submissions for the 18th Nama edition were opened on December 1. Nacz uses Nama as a platform to recognise outstanding achievements within the arts sector by rewarding creativity, innovation and excellence.
