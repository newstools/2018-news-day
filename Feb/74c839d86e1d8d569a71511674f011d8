GWERU City Council has rehabilitated a 27km road network after receiving $2,6 million from the Zimbabwe National Road Authority (Zinara), the Southern Eye has established. BY STEPHEN CHADENGA The pothole-riddled roads, particularly in the high-density suburb of Mkoba, had become impassable. Provincial Affairs minister Owen Ncube commended council for the road project, which he said would go a long way in attracting potential investors to the city. “It is pleasing to note that eight projects have been completed covering a total distance of 27km,” he said yesterday during a tour of the Zinara-funded emergency road rehabilitation programme. “I would like to thank Zinara for their efforts to partner with the government by availing funds for the rehabilitation of the national roads including those in urban councils. We are confident that such partnerships will continue as infrastructure development is a prerequisite for economic development and the new political dispensation is working tirelessly to attract investment.” Ncube said good infrastructure had the potential to bring confidence to investors who in turn would bring economic development. Mayor Charles Chikozho said council refurbished the Mkoba-City road, Senga-City route, as well as the road from Mkoba 5 turn-off to Mkoba 20. He said his council had plans to refurbish the Woodlands-City road which he said had been badly damaged by the rains that recently pounded the city.
