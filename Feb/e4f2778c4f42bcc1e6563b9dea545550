JAIROS Jiri Association national executive director, Wilson Ruvere has called on the government to facilitate access to equal opportunities and inclusion in the educational sector for people living with disabilities so that they can also contribute to national development. BY TAFADZWA MUTACHA Ruvere told NewsDay on the sidelines of the handover of a $2 000 donation from Zimoco to the association at Jairos Jiri Children’s Centre in Southerton, Harare, yesterday that there was need to scale up efforts to integrate people living with disabilities into mainstream society. “We fight for equal opportunities for our children. We want them to be integrated in everything that other children do, be it education or sports. We are fighting hard for their rights and their inclusion,” he said. Ruvere expressed gratitude to Zimoco for the donation, which he said would be used to purchase items, such as wheelchairs, to improve the children’s mobility. Zimoco marketing manager Louisa Evans said disability was not inability and pledged the company’s continued support towards fully integrating people living with disabilities in society. She said she was happy that the computerisation of the manufacturing sector offered opportunities to the disabled. Evans appreciated the work done by the staff at Jairos Jiri, which has over the years contributed to the school’s high pass rate, which stands at 70% at Grade 7. Jairos Jiri Children’s Centre was established in 1963 to provide basic education to children with disabilities drawn from peripheral rural communities and other places across the country.
