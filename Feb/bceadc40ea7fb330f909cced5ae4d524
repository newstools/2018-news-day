SOUTH African-based civil engineering firm, Terracotta Construction Private Limited, has called for maximum co-operation from Bulawayo residents and other stakeholders during construction of Egodini mall at the city’s busiest commuter omnibus terminus. BY ALEXIS SIBANDA Addressing a stakeholders’ meeting on Thursday, company director, Thulani Moyo, said the first phase of Egodini Mall construction will commence on March 1 and “vendors are urged to cooperate with the constructors because they will be relocated to new vending bays, in a move that is meant to clear traffic in the area. We encourage you all to co-operate with us because we all want to move quickly and see the completion of our project”. “All informal traders will get equal share to allow people to store different things, but not everybody will work there except those that are registered traders. We do not want to inconvenience all those vendors that are registered,” he said. Moyo added: “We need to get the entire infrastructure fixed, so that we will be able to do well in our business and make lots of money. We are aiming at making our Bulawayo better and doing away with those situations that differentiate Bulawayo from other places.” Terracota won the tender to develop a $60 million shopping mall at Basch Street bus terminus in 2012. As part of the deal, the company was awarded a 99-year lease to the terminus. According to council, the project has a potential to create thousands of jobs for unemployed Bulawayo youths. Past projects carried out by the company include Edendale Shopping Mall in Pietermaritzburg, Kwazulu Natal, Chris Hani Crossing Taxi facility in Gauteng and the Tsakane Mall taxi rank again in Gauteng.
