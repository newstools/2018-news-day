CHIKURUBI female prisoners were in for a treat on Valentine’s Day on Wednesday after Vice-President Constantino Chiwenga’s wife, Marry, donated groceries, computers and machines for their sewing projects. BY WINSTONE ANTONIO Through her Mushamukadzi Charitable Foundation, Chiwenga donated disposable sanitary pads, six bales of clothes, soap and raw materials for the making of reusable sanitary pads. She said through her organisation, prisoners would be taught how to make reusable sanitary pads. “We might have brought you some sanitary pads, but what next when they are finished? We decided to buy you five sewing machines so that we can teach you how to make reusable sanitary pads as we have done with the Doma people,” Chiwenga said during a visit to the facility. She applauded prisoners pursing studies, saying this would empower and equip them with knowledge. “Knowledge gives you power, that is why we have brought you five computers for use for your researches. If there is no Internet, we will talk to the authorities to see if we can facilitate for you to have wi-fi so that you do your researches” Chiwenga said. Zimbabwe Prisons and Correctional Services Commissioner-General Retired Major General Paradzai Zimondi said the donation would go a long way in helping the female prisoners. Chikurubi Female Prison officer-in-charge Mary Misihairambwi expressed concern at the deplorable condition of prison cells. “Our cells were constructed during the colonial era. The environment is not friendly to women, especially in terms of privacy, when they want to change clothes  and during their monthly menstrual cycles,” she said.
