ZIMBABWE A national cricket team lost their one-off T-20 cricket match against Kenya A by seven wickets at Mutare Sports Club yesterday. by Sports Reporter After whitewashing their guests in the one-day series, Zimbabwe were expected to continue the winning run in the 20-overs version of the game, but they found themselves on the receiving end. The hosts went in to bat first and they struggled to impose themselves as they lost wickets at regular intervals. In the end they managed 110 runs in their allotted 20 overs which didn’t give the bowlers something to work with. Kenya raced to the target in 14.4 overs with Dhiren Gondaria’s unbeaten 68 being the top score for the Kenyans. Wellington Masakadza, Tino Mutombodzi and 20-year-old Rugare Magarira claimed a wicket each, but there wasn’t any more success to write home about. Once the batsmen struggled to put an imposing total on the board, the bowlers were always going to find it tough to defend such a low score. Skipper Prince Masvaure top-scored for Zimbabwe with 23 while opener Chamu Chibhabha hit 20 and Mutombodzi made 19. Cephas Zhuwao, who lit up the one-day series with some brutal batting displays, struggled yesterday and was dismissed after facing three balls, one of which he heaved for a maximum, before he became Kenya A’s first wicket. Meanwhile, the Zimbabwe and Ireland women’s national teams’ match was abandoned without a ball being bowled due to a wet outfield following rains that fell on Sunday and yesterday morning.
