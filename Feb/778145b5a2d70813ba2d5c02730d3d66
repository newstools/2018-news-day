GOSPEL musician Amos Mahendere is set to bring life to the mining town of Kwekwe tomorrow with a performance at Maungira Edenga’s album launch at Rainbow Theatre. BY JAIROS SAUNYAMA The energetic dancer will be sharing the stage with fast-rising choral group, Vadzidzi Vekutanga, Mother Chimuka and upcoming gospel artiste Spencer Mugoni. Maungira Edenga will be launching their seven-track album titled Kuchema KweVana VeIsrael, after having been off the radar since 2012. The ensemble is led by twin brothers Everisto and Sylvester Mutema. Everisto confirmed Mahendere’s performance and said they were honoured to have such a big musician in their home town. “As a group we are happy to have Mahendere, who is our mentor and brother. However, the good thing is that as one of the few groups from the Methodist Church of Zimbabwe recording hymns, we are happy that we have an album out there. We have launched it in Kwekwe so that we honour our own community,” he said. Maungira Edenga has worked with Somandla Ndebele on the song Gamba, a tribute to the late sungura icon Tongai Moyo who hailed from Kwekwe. They also featured Richard Mapfumo of Vadzidzi Vekutanga group. Maungira Edenga consists of six members from the Methodist Church in Zimbabwe. Mahendere said he was ready for the event and urged gospel music lovers to turn up in large numbers. “I will be in Kwekwe on Saturday night and I am ready to show the fans that I still have the energy. I still have the moves. I urge the Kwekwe community to attend the album launch and support one of their own musicians,” he said. Maungira Edenga was formed on 2002 using the name Vawadzani Vedenga led by Bishop Pfeveni in a bid to popularise MCZ hymns. The group launched its first album Rwendo RweKudenga in 2003 before another one Mira Pamukaha in 2006. The group then split in 2012 leading to the formation to the Mutema-led ensemble. They then released their debut album the following year.
