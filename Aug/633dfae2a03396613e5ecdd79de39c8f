MSASS chairperson Ritzi Mbengerenwa told NewsDay Life & Style that a lot of entertainment was lined up for all the three days. “On the main arena on day two, we have competitions on drum majorettes from 10am to 12pm and then traditional dance groups from different mines and other places will compete in traditional songs and dances category,” she said. Mbengeranwa said they were going to host the Miss MSASS 2018 beauty pageant in the evening and prizes for the best groups and individuals would be given on the third day.

Meanwhile, Adrian Musa, one of the entertainment organisers, said they decided to give traditional groups a chance as digital music artistes performed last year. “Also considering that Matabeleland South province is labelled the rainbow province because of its cultural diversity, hence the inclusion of cultural dances drawn from all the districts of the province,” Musa said. He said showgoers should also expect to watch tug of war, Zimbabwe Prisons and Correctional brass band and fire fighting displays.
