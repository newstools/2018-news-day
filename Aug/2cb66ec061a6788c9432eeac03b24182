BY ANESU MUSHAWATU The festival, running under the theme; Artistes Unite Against Early Marriages, will bring together artistes from different African countries to create awareness on child rights and campaign against early marriages. Montana will share the stage with several top Zambian acts, including Amayenge, Maureen Lilanda, Kuza, Suwilanji and James Chamanyazi. The Sara Ugarike hitmaker told NewsDay Life & Style yesterday that he was excited about the recognition. “I feel honoured to be invited as a main performer where they have a great line-up of Zambian top musicians. It will be my first time performing there and I am really looking forward to it,” he said. “The idea that I am also part of something meaningful to the Zambian community makes the whole experience special.” Que Montana said gaining regional and international recognition was a long-cherished dream. The musician, who recently released his fifth album Sara Ugarike, said he will be taking his fresh music to the Zambian market. “We will be taking our fifth release to the festival and we will also be distributing the new music to the stations as they have requested for interviews,” he said. The former Andy Brown guitarist will officially launch Sara Ugarike on September 14 at Alliance Francaise in Harare.
