SOUTH Africa-based RnB songstress Ashleigh Moyo, popularly known as “Shashl” in music circles, has released her first single — Blow it in the Wind — under the major recording label, Universal Music. BY ANESU MUSHAWATU The songstress, who is the daughter of Chitungwiza Hospital chief executive officer, Obadiah Moyo, became the first local female musician signed under Universal Music, South Africa. The company is part of the world’s leading music company, Universal Music Group. Moyo said her new single was proof of why she sealed the deal with the label and expressed excitement at the turn of events. “I was  definitely nervous, but excited and at the same time I felt the pressure because everyone was expecting something amazing and  I think from the feedback so far I have managed to prove why I got signed to Universal,” she said. Shashl, who was nominated at the 2018 edition of the African Magazine Muzik Awards (Afrimma) in the Best Female Southern Africa category, said the nomination came as a surprise. “It was definitely a surprise to me I never thought for a second I would be nominated for a continental award at this early stage,” Shashl said. She said the development was a “big step” in her career, adding that she was currently working on a number of singles to allow people to grow into her sound before she releases a full album.
