EIGHTEEN-YEAR-OLD Beitbridge model Amanda Makati has broken into the big league and will be one of the 55 models taking part in the Harare Fashion week which begins in Harare today. BY REX MPHISA Running under the theme #TheRebirth, the Fashion Week will run until Friday. “Harare is set to become a vibrant new scene for the contemporary African Fashion. The theme #TheRebirth is representing life, eternity and continuity. As we breathe new life, we are born again to new beginnings and a new renewal,” Fashion Week said on their website. Makati, the reigning Miss Beitbridge 2016/2017, told NewsDay Life & Style that she was excited to be part of the Fashion Week. “I feel so excited and grateful for being part of the fashion show. The event is great and that’s how I feel, great,” she said yesterday. “This is my first time doing runway modelling and it’s also my first time going out of my home town.” About 55 models from around the country will be parading their beauty at the event. The Harare showcase will come as some form of saving grace for Amanda after she and several other beauty models were duped by a fly by night Beitbridge promoter, who never gave the models their prizes after his ill-fated pageant.
