POLICE yesterday invited Budiriro MDC Alliance MP-elect Costa Machingauta for questioning in connection with the violence that rocked Harare on August 1. by OBEY MANAYITI His lawyer Tarisai Mutangi of the Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights (ZLHR) confirmed the development. Mutangi said his client was released after police had recorded information they wanted to extract. “The police are making enquiries concerning his alleged involvement in the demonstrations of August 1. So they have claimed to have information that is linking him to that event of which he denies. We were there since midmorning and left in the afternoon,” he said. “They said they are making further enquiries and if they want to speak to him they will invite him again.” Asked if he thought this amounted to persecution, Mutangi said it was too early to make a conclusion to that effect unless if police had detained him.
