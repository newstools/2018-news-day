ETHNO soul diva Thandeka “Thandy” Dhlana yesterday said she was honoured to be the headline act at the Thandy Dhlana Acoustic Night set for August 31 in Bulawayo where upcoming artistes will get lessons on grooming and marketing. BY SHARON SIBINDI She said although the organiser’s decision to have her at the event to be held at the Homestead Conference Centre came as a surprise, it was a good platform to sharpen the skills of young artistes. “This was a surprise (but) I feel honoured to be part of the event and also to headline it. The event is a good platform for us young artistes to grow and showcase our talent in the industry,” she said. Anotida Moyo, who is part of the organising team, said the event was important for young artistes. “We need to groom young artistes like me and put them on a professional stage which is well marketable and introduce them to the corporate world,” he said. Moyo, who is also a student at Zimbabwe School of Mines, said they hoped to hold the event annually. “I once did this in 2012, but I was not the leader. The event was started by Tariro Negitare in Harare and it was a cultural exchange with a group from Germany. So they have been doing that in Harare, I think for more than ten years,” he said. Moyo said 10 upcoming artistes would perform on the day and there would be a variety of music genres as well as poetry and stand-up comedy. “The performances will be more of a chilled environment and jazz environment for mature people,” he said.
