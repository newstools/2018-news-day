Police in Marondera have arrested four men for allegedly killing their friend using a fan belt and switches as punishment for getting too drunk to walk. BY JAIROS SAUNYAMA Tendai Nyanhi (35), Kenneth Kalongona (20), Watson Rakabopa (18) and a 13-year-old juvenile are facing murder charges following the death of Simbarashe Bofu (23), whom they allegedly assaulted for consuming excessive alcohol. Mashonaland East acting provincial police spokesperson Inspector Tendai Mwanza confirmed the incident and said people should desist from engaging in violence. According to police, on August 22, the now-deceased was drinking beer at Changireza Bottle Store in the company of the quartet. It is reported that during the drinking spree, the team were consuming a cocktail mixture of the illicit Mbarure spirit with Eagle Lager beer. It is reported that the bottle store closed and the now-deceased was dozing before he was dragged outside by his friends. It is alleged that when they got outside, Bofu failed to walk and this did not go down well with his friends, who assaulted him with a fan belt and switches all over the body. They forced him to walk for a kilometre before dumping him on the roadside to Elmswood Park. It is reported that the following morning, one of the deceased’s friends, Nyanhi, returned to where they had left him and found him still there. Nyanhi then approached the deceased’s neighbour, Ernest Mutungwazi (42), who took him to Marondera Provincial Hospital, where he was pronounced dead on admission. A report was made at Marondera Rural Police, who attended the scene and arrested the accused. The deceased sustained bruises on both hands and had a swollen face.
