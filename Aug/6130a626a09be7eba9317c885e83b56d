The singer told Southern Eye Life &Style yesterday that he was happy local fans were embracing hip-hop at national level. “It is a motivating feeling, especially when my track is doing better than I expected as the money is not equal to the moves we are making, but I feel topping the charts is a good way to get noticed nationwide so the money will come,” he said. “For me, topping the charts means Zimbabwe is ready to embrace hip-hop and I am honoured that people are believing in our genre and I don’t know where the song will take me.” With the continued dominance of the song, Mambo, Asaph said he had been forced to shelve some already completed new projects which were ready for release. “A new project might happen next year because of how Mambo is doing on the charts. I would like it to run its course without distracting people before I introduce the new single and an EP I was set to release,” he said. “The secret to my success this year, I believe, was remaining focused on my initial plan. Many people want you to jump from a moving train and make you change direction, but if you believe in yourself and work hard, pray, remain humble and focus, then anything you do will succeed,” Tarukwana added.
