Harare magistrate Nyasha Vhitorini has granted $50 bail each to 27 MDC Alliance activists who are accused of participating in violent protests in Harare over delays by the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission in announcing presidential election results. In passing the ruling magistrate Vhitorini castigated the State for charging the accused persons as a group yet their circumstances of arrest differed. The accused persons, who are facing charges of public violence, include losing MDC Alliance candidate for Harare South, Shadreck Mashayamombe, Tapiwa Joni, Ngonidzashe Makazhu, Michael Mheta, Simbarashe Mujeye, Judith Chacha and Lilian Mahosi.BY DESMOND CHINGARANDE
