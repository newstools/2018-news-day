BULAWAYO gospel singer Chelsea Mguni, popularly known as Saved Diva, has described her debut solo album launch as the first step to greater heights in her burgeoning music career. BY SINDISO DUBE The musician launched her album, The Praise Offering, on Friday night at a well-attended event at Elite 300. “The album means the beginning for me and my maturity and my breakthrough to ministry through music. It is a testimony to me and to other aspiring musicians, who want to launch their careers and it should show everyone that it’s possible with God,” she said. Mguni, who is a member of the renowned gospel group, Vocal Ex, said the launch was an overwhelming experience. “I have ministered in front of big crowds before with a group, but on Friday it was a different note as the show was mine alone. It was overwhelming seeing people that had come to support me. I almost broke into tears when I got onto the stage on seeing the cheering crowds.” The 10-track album took her only a month to compose and she attributed that to the team behind the scenes, which she said she had worked with before at Vocal Ex.
One of the tracks Pirori, a praise song, is set to become a breakaway hit track. Mguni has lined up a number of shows across the country in a bid to promote her debut album. There is also an international show slated for the United Kingdom in November that awaits her. The 23-year-old musician is currently studying for a higher diploma in human resources management.
