BY SHARON SIBINDI Thandy featured at the Bulawayo Jazz Festival held recently at the Homestead Conference Centre. She told NewsDay Life & Style that she was overwhelmend by the love she received from her fans, but hinted that she would be making some adjustments following her marriage and the recent arrival of her baby. “I am back with a bang and I was overwhelmed when fans showed appreciation for my music. I am so humbled that people still know my lyrics and the vibe was too much,” she said.
Thandy said her performance brought back memories of the time she shared the stage with X-mile. “I promise my fans more gigs and festivals to follow. I promise to deliver my best. I was humbled to be chosen to play at the Jazz Festival, particularly sharing the stage with Ammara Brown,” she said. “Being a mother is a blessing. Motherhood is exciting and it’s also a life-changing experience. It’s treating me great. It’s not about ‘me’ anymore because I have got moments when I feel lost and frustrated, but when my baby smiles, all that changes.”
