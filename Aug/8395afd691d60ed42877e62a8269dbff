He was back in the country this week for this year’s edition which he won convincingly to walk away with a $1 000 prize money and a trophy. He made it a double after he combined with Jimmy Schebusch to clinch the men’s doubles competition, beating locals Mike Burns and Neil Nesbitt 3-1. The ladies’ singles was won by Nigerian Yemisi Olatunji who beat her sister Busayo 3-1 to claim the $1 000 prize-money and a trophy. Zambian Paul Chanda beat fellow countryman Felix Chilufya 3-1 in the veterans’ category. Potgieter was happy with the way the tournament − run by the Matabeleland Squash Association − was organised and promised to return next year. “The organisation is great. It is a great tournament. We will bring more South Africans for next year’s tournament and I will be back to defend the title,” Potgieter said. This year’s competition attracted players from Zimbabwe, South Africa, Nigeria, Zambia, Malawi and debutants Swaziland.
