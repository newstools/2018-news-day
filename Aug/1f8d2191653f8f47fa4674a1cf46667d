A MUTARE commuter omnibus conductor was on Saturday hauled to court on allegations of raping a 16-year-old pupil in the eastern border city. BY KENNETH NYANGANI Benjamin Mutingwende (33), a conductor with Dragon Tours, appeared before Mutare magistrate Lazarus Murendo. He was remanded to September 10 for trial on $50 bail. It is the State’s case that sometime in December 2017, the accused proposed love to the complainant, who accepted the proposal. The court heard that during the afternoon of July 23 this year, the complainant invited Mutingwende to the city centre and he complied. Upon arrival, Mutingwende reportedly took complainant to his friend’s house in Sakubva. Prosecutor John Munyurwa told the court that the accused’s friend then went outside the house, leaving the two alone, leading to the alleged rape. The matter came to light when the complainant arrived home late and told her parents about the ordeal. Her parents then escorted her to file a police report.
