THE Zimbabwe Tourism Authority (ZTA) on Tuesday announced that they had reached an agreement with government to make the Zimbabwe Peace Festival an annual event. BY ALBERT MASAKA ZTA chief executive officer Karikoga Kaseke told NewsDay Life & Style on the sidelines of a media briefing by church leaders on the success of the inaugural festival held last month that there were plans to make the event bigger. “We agreed with the government that the peace festival is now an annual event meant to pray for peace in the country, whether they are elections or no elections. We are yet to come up with the dates, but next year’s event is going to be bigger and better,” he said. Kaseke said ZTA wanted to rope in churches in organising the annual music festival, while the authority would spearhead it by handling the budget and logistics. The move has brought joy to gospel artistes, with the country’s legendary gospel musicians Mechanic Manyeruke and Charles Charamba giving a thumbs up to the ZTA and government for their efforts in calling for peace in the country through gospel music. Charamba said peace was one of the most scarce and expensive comodities in the world. “Thumbs up to ZTA for drafting such an unusual thing on our calendar,” he said, adding that gospel musicians should embrace the invite because it was “God-inspired”. Manyeruke said he was fully behind the initiative: “Our country has peace-loving people who are also hospitable.” He urged other gospel artistes to rally behind the programme.
