BULAWAYO CITY….0
HERENTALS…….(0)1 YOUNG Tinotenda Benza rose from the bench to pile misery on troubled Bulawayo City as Herentals picked up crucial away points in a Castle Lager Premier Soccer League match at Barbourfields Stadium yesterday. BY FORTUNE MBELE Benza was introduced on the 57th minute for Aaron Chiwandamidzi and barely 10 minutes after he had come in, he set up by his father, Innocent Benza, before the forward pushed the ball past an advancing City goalkeeper Munyaradzi Diya to give Herentals the winner. Had it not been for Carlos Mavhurume missing a penalty in the 31st minute after Blessing Maunganidze was brought down inside the box by defender Benson Nyoni, Herentals could have won the match by a two-goal margin. Bulawayo City have lost seven games on the trot and alarm bells have started ringing for the local authority side, who have engaged three coaches so far this season. Current coach Bekithemba Ndlovu has lost three matches to FC Platinum, Black Rhinos and Herentals yesterday. They sit on position 17 on the log table, with a paltry 15 points. Ndlovu was a disappointed man after 90 minutes. “It’s disappointing. The position we are is not good. We don’t need to be dropping points at this stage,” Ndlovu said. His counterpart Kumbirai Mutiwekuziva said it was a poor showing for his boys, but it was important that they collected maximum points. “A very difficult match for us; we did not play to the best off our ability. However, it is a good result even if we did not play well and that is important because we are playing to remain in the Premier Soccer League next season,” Mutiwekuziva said.
