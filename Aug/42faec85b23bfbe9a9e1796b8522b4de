Herentals coach Kumbirai Mutiwekuziva is optimistic that his team will collect maximum points ahead of their clash with Chapungu in a Castle Lager Premier Soccer League match at Rufaro Stadium this afternoon. BY Garish Phiri Chapungu, who sit precariously close to the relegation zone, won the reverse fixture and Herentas will be looking to make use of home advantage and win this one. Mutiwekuziva has a clean bill of health and will want to follow up on their mid-week win over Bulawayo City with another set of three points. Their form has seen them win two of their last five matches, losing only once. “We are ready for the game, we have prepared since we have our full squad back in training. The morale in the camp is high as we managed to collect maximum points from our last encounter against Bulawayo City.  William Kapumha and Brighton Majarira are back in the squad and that has given us a boost,” he said. Ninth-placed Herentals have collected 30 points so far, with a nine-point buffer with the relegation zone while Chapungu have 24 points. Herentals will be without forward Archmore Majarira, who is out due to suspension.
