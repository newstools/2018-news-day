ORGANISERS of the Congolese rhumba artiste Koffi Olomide concert Sound Blaze Productions have been pushed to move the show that was scheduled for yesterday to tonight due to political tensions witnessed in Harare after Monday’s harmonised elections.

Addressing a Press conference in Harare yesterday, Olomide said he felt safe in Zimbabwe and said he was prepared to die for his local fans on stage. “I had missed my Zimbabwean fans who are always in touch with me via messages such that I said I will be there despite that problems could be faced after elections,” he said. “I am prepared to die for the fans on stage. I have driven around the city (Harare) and have assessed that the situation is calm. I love Zimbabwe from the bottom of my heart.” Olomide, who promised a great show also saluted raunchy dancer Beverly Sibanda, who featured on his video saying she was a talented dancer. The concert organiser, Calisto Murawo of Sound Blaze, told the same conference that they have been assured maximum security. “Due to reasons beyond our control we have decided to push the show to tomorrow (Today) at the same venue HICC as earlier announced,” he said. “We have talked to the relevant authorities and we have been guaranteed maximum security for the show so we urge Zimbabweans to come in their numbers.” The latest developments, therefore, mean there are two high profile concerts tonight as Jamaican dancehall reggae singer Charly Black will also be performing in the country at LongCheng Plaza in Harare. Although the two artistes appeal to different fans, it will definitely be battle for fans by the two promoters. One of the Charly Black concert organisers, Simbarashe “Dhama” Chanachimwe of David House Promotions, however, downplayed the clash. “We are not worried about Koffi Olomide performing on the same day with Charly Black, as they are two different artistes with variance in audiences,” he said. Olomide is set to share the stage with Winky D, Jah Signal, Alick Macheso, Leonard Zhakata and Sulumani Chimbetu, while Charly Black will be supported by Soul Jah Love, Guspy Warrior, Freeman, Kinnah, Dadza D and Queen Khadija.
