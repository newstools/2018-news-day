SOUTH Africa-based Matabeleland Entertainment News (MEN) has appealed to the Zimbabwean government to value the Joshua Nkomo Day commemorations, which have become an annual event in Johannesburg. BY SHARON SIBINDI Following the sixth edition of the annual Dr Joshua Mqabuko Nkomo celebrations through arts at the Aleck Gorshel Park in Johannesburg, South Africa at the weekend, organiser Mongezi Mpofu told NewsDay Life & Style that they were appealing to the Zimbabwe government to catch up. “We are happy that each year this event is growing and we wish that such events can be held back home. We are kindly pleading with our government to see the importance of these events. It’s such a shame that after so many years, we still do not have a Joshua Nkomo Day whereas next door, in South Africa, they have a Nelson Mandela’s Day,” Mpofu said. Mpofu said the event was a success as it had brought over 2 000 Zimbabweans together. “We also saw that a lot of youths have lost their identity as they try to fit in. Through the event, we got to know that very few know something about our heroes such as Joshua Nkomo back home, as they are the ones who made a difference in Zimbabwe,” he said. The South Africa-based star said different types of traditional dances and songs were showcased by different groups at the event, which was bankrolled by Kingdom  Blue Funeral Service. Several artistes performed imbube and isitshikitsha genres as well as some poetry. “It was graced by legendary Saul Gwakuba Ndlovu together with Mehluli Moyo from Joshua Nkomo Cultural Movement,” Mpofu said. Nkomo, who was vice-president, died on July 1, 1999.
