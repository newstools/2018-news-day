HIGHLANDERS’ skipper Gabriel Nyoni has said the team is letting goalkeeper Ariel Sibanda down by failing to complement his brilliance in goals with end product upfront. BY FORTUNE MBELE While Sibanda has been doing well between the sticks, Bosso have struggled for goals upfront. In their last match, Sibanda saved a Themba Ndlovu spot-kick for Highlanders to settle for a goalless draw against Nichrut. The veteran shot-stopper saved Highlanders from the blushes of another defeat in their previous Castle Lager Premier Soccer League tie from marauding Triangle at Gibbo Stadium last month when he saved another penalty in a game that the Bulawayo giants eventually won 1-0, courtesy of a Newman Sianchali goal last month. Nyoni wants to see his team improving their conversion rate. “We are not scoring as a team; from defenders, midfielders, wingers and strikers. He (Sibanda) has been saving us from point-blank saves to penalties but we are not scoring to complement his brilliant work. For how long will he continue to save us? We need to look at ourselves and start scoring as a team,” Nyoni said. This followed an earlier post on Twitter after the Saturday game in which Nyoni said as a team, they were letting Sibanda down. “We are letting you down big man. Thank you for the penalty saves. Two games, two penalty saves and 11 clean sheets,” Nyoni said. In May, at Barbourfields Stadium, Sibanda also saved Highlanders from a Caps United onslaught by making spectacular saves which saw Highlanders get away with a point, in a match that the Green Machine dominated and ended in a goalless draw. Highlanders have another tough assignment on Thursday when they host in-form Chicken Inn at Barbourfields Stadium. The two sides drew 2-2 in a four-goal thriller at the same venue in April.
