Simbisa Brands, a Zimbabwe Stock Exchange-isted (ZSE) fast foods operator, is on drive to expand the footprint of the Nando’s brand to meet growing demand for its services. BY VANESSA GONYE Yesterday the restaurant chain opened its tenth Nando’s branch in the country, seventh in Harare and is planning on opening three more branches by year-end. Simbisa Brands Chief Executive Officer, Warren Meares, said there was high and growing demand for Nando’s in many areas other than Harare. Meares said this during the official opening of the Nando’s Msasa branch, which was refurbished at a cost of $700 000. “Things are going on well for us despite the economic climate and we are grateful for the support we have from our Zimbabwean customers as they keep demanding for more and that is the reason why we are opening more branches and we will make sure that other towns besides Harare have branches too,” said Meares. Also speaking at the same event, Nando’s Country manager, Steve Chamboko, said the expansion would build societies and create jobs for many seeking employment. “The $700 000 investment is just another stepping stone on our expansion within the country; as we launch in Msasa, we now take our staff compliment up to 320 employees with future Casas (outlets) planned for Sam Levy’s Village, Fife Avenue, Gweru and Victoria Falls by the end of the year.” “As Zimbabwe looks to our future, so do we at Nando’s, as we continue to keep providing opportunities for investment, employment and enjoyment,” Chamboko said. The new and revamped complex, situated along Mutare Road in Msasa, will houses four other Simbisa brands, Chicken Inn, Pizza Inn, Creamy Inn, Baker’s Inn and Nando’s.
