THIRTEEN people were killed while 110 were injured in various accidents that occurred during the just-ended Heroes and Defence Forces holidays, police said in a statement. BY STAFF REPORTER A total of 141 traffic accidents were recorded compared to 119  last year. The number of fatalities remained unchanged, while the number of those injured decreased to 100 from 110 in the comparative period. Police spokesperson Senior Assistant Commissioner Charity Charamba said the number of fatalities remained of concern. “It is quite disheartening to note that whilst there were no major fatalities recorded along the highways, the recorded fatalities are still of concern to police. It is our fervent hope that motorist will work towards showing good driving conduct as to preserve lives on the roads,” she said. Charamba attributed the accidents to speeding, inattention or misjudgments and tyre bursts. She urged pedestrians to be on the lookout for errant motorists who do not stop or give way at junctions and implored public transport operators to employ drivers with requisite qualifications.
