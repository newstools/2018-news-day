ZPGA director of golf development, William Lake, expressed delight at the development, saying it is set to develop golf as a major sport in the country. “This directly benefits our local golfing community in that they will have access to the world’s finest coaching and teaching programmes so that our Zimbabwean golfing public can improve their games. We want to develop the game across our country,” he said. ZGA believe that with better knowledge, the local players can improve their games. ZPGA president Gary Thompson, who recently returned from the British Senior Open, said the arrangement, once in place, is set to enhance development of the game and create employment opportunities. “We are very thankful to those behind this development. Our focus goes beyond tournaments and professional performance. It will take time, but our local pros and those who want to become teaching pros those with a five handicaps or better are welcome,” Thompson said. “Those who want to work in the golfing industry should have at least five ‘O’ Levels. Those who want to get into golf teaching are also welcome. We will better their knowledge of coaching so that they get a global accreditation into pro golf.” The ZPGA recently partnered with the Harare City Council in the revival of the Harare Open golf tournament. The tournament makes a return on the local golfing calendar this week after a four-year absence with a lucrative prize fund of $20 000 on offer. The tournament was last held in 2014 and it disappeared after losing sponsorship. It returns to Chapman Golf Club from August 9 to10. There were at least 50 entries for this edition by yesterday. “We have over 50 entries and a lot of interest from the South Africans, so we’re pretty excited for Harare,” Lake said. Some of Zimbabwe’s best female athletes have been invited for a surprise and will be announced after the prize-giving ceremony
