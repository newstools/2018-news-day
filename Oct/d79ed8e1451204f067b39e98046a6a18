CONGO Brazzaville has thrown wide open the Group G of the Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers after beating Liberia 3-1 at the Stade Alphonse Massemba-Débat in Brazzaville yesterday. BY HENRY MHARA With the victory, Congo now have four points, the same number with current group leaders Zimbabwe and second placed Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Winless Liberia are bottom of the standings with a point, and they will need to beat Congo in the return leg in Monrovia next week to remain in contention. Zimbabwe and DRC face off in Kinshasa tomorrow evening, before the return leg in Harare at the National Sports Stadium on Tuesday evening. A team that will collect six points in this top of the table clash will secure their place at the Afcon finals set for Cameroon next year. In yesterday’s match, Congo raced ahead in the 15th minute through a goal by Merveil Valthy Ndockyt, but Sam Johnson equalised two minutes after the break. Prince Ibara restored the home side’s lead on the hour mark, before Caen midfielder Prince Oniangue made sure of the points at the death. Two teams form this group will qualify for the finals.
