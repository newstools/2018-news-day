UNITED KINGDOM-BASED hip-hop musician Tinashe “Karizma” Sahanga has fused his genre with Afro-jazz in his latest eight-track album, Fakazi, released over the weekend in a bid to broaden the fan base. BY TAFADZWA KACHIKO Karizma said the album, named after his late father, represented the rebirth of his hip-hop music, which is now spiced with some Afro-jazz flavour. “The album represents my rebirth in music circles, exemplified by the new sound. This is more Afro-jazz influenced hip-hop that is more like a young rapping version of Tuku. Fakazi means witness in Ndebele, but it is also my late father’s name. I took on the persona of Fakazi as an alter ego to my more upbeat pop music self,” he said. “It’s also a dedication to my father who represents the calmer and more introspective side. As I went through the process, I found myself wanting to honour my mother as well. I do this through themes I discuss in the album.” Karizma was confident that his new and unique hip-hop would help him win favour from jazz music lovers. “The biggest stumbling block was failure to really distinguish my style from every hip-hop out there. This new direction is relatively fresh and it gives me a unique selling point. I believe this is going to broaden my fan base as it connects with jazz music lovers,” he said. The hip-hop musician said staying in the diaspora distanced himself from fans back home. “It’s been a long road of growth and discovery. Being in the diaspora has definitely affected my career, both negatively and positively,” he said. “Exposure to different art and culture has given me a different creative perspective that uniquely influences my music. I, however, miss out so much. I hardly have an opportunity to perform before my fans back home.” Stream the album below <iframe width="100%" height="300" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/630234624&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true&amp;visual=true"></iframe>
