ZIMBABWE were the biggest movers of all the African countries on the Fifa rankings released yesterday, following their impressive performance in the back-to-back Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers against the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) this month. BY HENRY MHARA The Warriors beat the Leopards 2-1 away in Kinshasa before holding the same 1-1 in Harare to collect four points, results that put them on the brink of 2019 Cameroon Afcon finals qualification. They need just one point from their remaining two matches to book their ticket to next yearâ€™s Afcon finals. Those two solid performances saw them becoming the biggest climbers of the African countries on the rankings, up seven spots to 110 in the world. In Africa, the Warriors moved three places to 27. Tunisia remains the top-ranked side in Africa and are up one place to 22 globally. World Cup winners France dropped one place to leave Belgium the highest ranked team overall by just one point.
