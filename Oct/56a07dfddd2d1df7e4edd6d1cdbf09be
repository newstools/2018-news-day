SOUTH AFRICA’S internationally-acclaimed afro-fusion band, Freshlyground, delighted fans at the Twelve Concert on Friday at Jam Tree in Mt. Pleasant, Harare as part of Twelve — Music Every Month series during which the venue hosts a different artiste every month of the year. BY WINSTONE ANTONIO Their sterling performance saw them belting hit after hit much to the delight of the cosmopolitan multiracial crowd that packed the intimate and lush venue and was kept on their feet throughout the show. Local acts including Blessing Chimanga, So Kindly, and Rob Macson among others who shared the stage with Freshlyground gave a good account of themselves, showing they were not push overs and justified the $15 entry charge for pre-tickets, $17,50 for online purchase and $20 on the night of the show. The concert organisers said the Twelve Concerts series, which that started in May this year, will continue through to June 2019.
