Movie viewing is scheduled from September 15 to October 25,” Mone said. Co-director Piotrowska said she felt humbled by such recognition given to Chidzonga and Escape. “Never before was a Zimbabwean nominated for this very prestigious awards ceremony. I am deeply honoured and delighted that Munya and the film have been honoured,” she said. Chidzonga attributed his success to hard work and urged rising filmmakers to work harder. “Never be satisfied, I am always hungry. I keep on striving for more. I would like to say to rising filmmakers be consistent and work hard. There is no substitute to going to auditions and networking events. For you to be on set, you have to get your hands dirty, dream big and start working towards your dream,” he said. The third edition of Sotigui will be held under the theme “Piracy in the Audiovisual Sector: How to Better Valorize, Protect and Defend our African Cinematographic and Audiovisual Works”. The ceremony, organised by Sotigui Academy in partnership with Panafrican Film and Television Festival of Ouagadougou, aims to contribute to the recognition and enhancement of the profession of actors, of African cinema and the  diaspora.
