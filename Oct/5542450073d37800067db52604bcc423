MOTIVATIONAL speaker and author, Simbarashe Nyamadzawo, on Wednesday night launched his third publication at a colourful event attended by people from different walks of life. BY BENIAH MUNENGWA The publication — a motivational novella titled Tatenda — is Nyamadzawo’s third after Faith Preneurship (2015) and Leadership Wisdom (2016). The author, who is also a leadership coach, said he was excited at the launch of his first novella and expressed gratitude to those who threw their weight behind his efforts. “I am glad about the positive feedback I am receiving from the people who have read Tatenda. It’s what encourages me to write more and be the man I want to become,” he said. Nyamadzawo said he was grateful for the helping hand he has received from Primary and Secondary Education minister Paul Mavima and LASOF Leadership Institute’s chief executive officer, Charles Mugaviri. Mugavari, who was the guest of honour at the launch, told the gathering that it was important for people to cultivate a reading culture so they could enhance their level of thinking. “Reading nurtures the mind, for unless your mind is cultivated, it remains closed,” he said. Mavima, who was represented by the director of National Library and Documenting Services in the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education, Tesah Stima, spoke glowingly about the publication. “Tatenda is a well-written book. It is an encounter with destiny. The country needs more writers like Simba. Such books like Tatenda should be considered for the curriculum,” he said. The launch also witnessed a lively discussion centred on the book,with a panel made up of Kudakwashe Garamukanwa, Jayne Terera, Kay Terera, Noah Mangwarara and the dean of Public Speakers in Zimbabwe, Felix Zinhara. Jayne Terera applauded Nyamadzawo’s style of merging financial literacy and motivational tenets in a creative book. “I recommend this relatable story for young people like me,” she said.
