Zirima claimed he wanted transport to travel to his rural home and Munyaradzi offered to take the former to Mvuma, where he was going. Upon arrival at Chicken Inn complex in Mvuma, Munyaradzi disembarked from his car and left Zirima seated on the passenger seat while he went inside the shop to buy some food, leaving the vehicle idling as he did not anticipate to take long in the shop.
