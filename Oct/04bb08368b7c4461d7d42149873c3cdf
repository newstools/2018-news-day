SHABANIE MINE . . . . (0) 1
Highlanders . . . . .  (1) 1 Shabanie Mine gave themselves another week or so before they are officially relegated from the Premier League after they held Highlanders at Maglas Stadium yesterday. BY TERRY MADYAUTA A defeat would have confirmed their demotion, and it looked like it would happen when Gabriel Nyoni gave Highlanders the lead after 23 minutes. However, the Chinda Boys rallied back with a spirited second half performance, which was rewarded by Fradreck Muza’s goal on the hour mark. Luck was also on Shabbanie’s side after Adrian Silla failed to convert a penalty to give Highlanders a two-goal lead, with his effort saved by goalie Biggie Temera. Highlanders assistant coach Mandla Mpofu, who was in charge in the absence of technical manager Madinda Ndlovu, was disappointed with the result. “We have lost two points and I am disappointed with this result, considering that we were playing against a team deep in the relegation zone. I thought we were the better side throughout the game. We had a good game plan, but sadly we could not walk away with three points. “We missed a penalty, but I am happy with the way the team is performing. The team is playing as a unit. Next season we will be looking at winning trophies because then, I think the team will be strong enough, to compete for honours,” Mpofu said. With the draw, Shabanie remained bottom of the standings with 19 points, while Highlanders also remained on sixth with 44 points. Shabanie Mine gaffer Alexio Sigion heaped praise on his charges for their fighting spirit despite their ever mounting in-house problems. “Like I said, we will keep fighting until the last game. I know it’s very difficult at the stage we are, but one day things will change for the good. We played well, considering that we were playing a team of high magnitude and we got a point. That alone means a lot to me and the team. Our goal now is to win the remaining matches and see how we end the season,” he said.
