BULAWAYO gospel music outfit One Way to Heaven is set to launch its third album, Udumo KuJehova, at Brethren in Christ Church (BICC) Central branch. BY SHARON SIBINDI The seven-member female ensemble, which sings African traditional Christian gospel music, will launch their 11-track album with the support of Abigirl Mwembe, Polani Ngwenya and Men of Influence. The group’s director, Courtesy Mtomba, told NewsDay Life & Style that all was set for the launch. “We will be launching our third album on Saturday and we will be performing live with a full band. The album carries a message of praising God in whatever situation we are in, acknowledging his presence even when you are in trials. As Christians, it is our mandate to worship Him,” she said. Mtomba said the previous two albums did well and with the new one, they were aiming higher. “Our previous albums performed fairly well and we appreciate it as the group. We are pleased and the albums are still selling up to today. We are also happy that at the moment, we have not yet been affected much by piracy,” she said. She said the group would hold live shows in the near future and plans were afoot for the group to have their debut concert this year in Gwanda. One Way to Heaven was the first group from Bulawayo to perform at the Gwanda Gospel Festival in 2016 and it has shared the stage with top South African gospel musician, Sipho Makhabane.
