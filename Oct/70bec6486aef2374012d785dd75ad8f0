FORMER Highlanders secretary Andrew Tapela was voted the new Zifa Southern Region chairperson after he trounced incumbent Musa Mandaza in an election that was held in Bulawayo yesterday. BY FORTUNE MBELE Tapela, who is not new to Zifa affairs, having previously served as a councillor, garnered 20 votes, while Mandaza who ruled since 2014, got seven votes. The former Highlanders secretary said top on the incoming board’s agenda will be to ensure that the Southern Region Soccer League gets a sponsor. “What is important is to keep the Southern Region intact and move forward. Top most for the incoming board is to make sure that this league (the Southern Region Soccer League) is branded so that at first whistle next season, every team in the league has got something to play for. I challenge my members of the board to say that is our promise and our priority. Suffice to say our direction is going to be driven by resource mobilization, to create partnerships and synergies and also capacity building,” Tapela said. He is joined in the new board by his deputy Gaylord Madhunguza of ZPC Hwange, who was retained as vice-chairperson and came into yesterday’s election unopposed. New members of the board are Mehluli Thebe Tizirayi Luphahla, Fizo Siziba and Bryton Malandule. Meanwhile, in the Harare region, Willard Manyengavana retained his post after beating former referee Brighton Mudzamiri. Manyengavana got 23 votes compared to Mudzamiri’s 11.
