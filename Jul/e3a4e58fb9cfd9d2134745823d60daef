THIS year’s edition of the Safeguard Zimbabwe Open Squash Tournament will be played from Friday to Sunday at the Suburbs Squash Club in Bulawayo. BY FORTUNE MBELE The draw for the competition will be held on Friday and only players present at registration on Thursday will qualify for the draw, according to the registration form. Locals struggled last year, with the men’s finals won by Nigerian Sodiq Taiwo, who walked away with $1 000 and a trophy after beating fellow countryman Olanrewaju Abulrahaman 3-2. South African Christo Potgieter did not turn up to defend his title last year due to other commitments after the competition had been dominated by Zambia since the beginning in 2004. Last year, Zimbabwe’s Admire Magwaza came position five in the men’s competition. The women’s title was also won by Nigerian Yemisi Olatunji who beat Zimbabwe’s Yvonne Mubure 3-0. The tournament features the men and women’s editions, the doubles and veterans’ contests and last year young squash sensation Ryan Gwidzima, then aged 11, beat 16-year-old Brighton Nyakabawo in the plate final. Registration for the singles is $25 and $40 per team for the doubles. However, if each member of the doubles team is also playing in the singles, the doubles team is expected to pay $30.
The entry fees were due to be paid on July 25. The Zimbabwe Open Squash Tournament was brought back to life by the Matabeleland Squash Association in 2004 and is an annual event at Bulawayo Squash Club.
