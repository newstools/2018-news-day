Harare Basketball Association (HBA) president Sani Mbofana has hinted that they are likely to have the same set of teams from last season in the new term. BY GARISH PHIRI HBA have scheduled their annual general meeting for August 25 to set the programme for the upcoming 2018-19 season.
The final decision will be passed at an annual general meeting (AGM). “We have an AGM coming on 25 August 2018 and this is when all decisions will be taken,” Mbofana said. “Without pre-emptying anything, the feeling is we will retain the 12-team A league. The 16-team Women’s League looks like it will be split with the Promotional/Non-Promotional.” Harare City Hornets are the defending champions in HBA League in the Women’s League, while Foxes where champions in the national league. Harare City Hornets have signed veteran Charity Mucucuti, Lorraine Manjoro from Mavericks in Bulawayo and Tracy Makovere from Vixens. Gideon Chikopa was appointed competitions commissioner and Mbofana believes Chikopa’s expertise would be vital. The executive is challenged to do more and plan for a better and exciting 2018-19 season. “A position of this magnitude requires a high level of integrity, as it has the potential of defining the best a league can offer or destroy it. We sought to bring in a guy who would look at all clubs as equal and a man who would not succumb to pressure to the so-called big guys in the game” he said. Mbofana said that the challenges they faced last season would not resurface this time. “Admittedly, we had challenges with our fixtures, results and log standings in the previous season. It is on that basis we have sought to bring in a new broom and I must point out we have so much confidence in the new board,” he said.
