Even ED has said people will be allowed to vote freely & the result will be recognized, fine we appreciate that – #Mugabe #NewsDayZim There are 23 candidates & people ask what is your choice & no one has said what is not your choice. I can’t vote for those who have tormented me – #Mugabe #NewsDayZim I work with Mai Mujuru, I work with Khupe. There’s Chamisa, I’ve not worked with him & I’ve seen him work with the late Tsvangirai & he seems to be doing well – #Mugabe #NewsDayZim I hope the voting which will be done tomorrow will reform, will thrash away military form of govt & bring us back to constitutionality – #Mugabe #NewsDayZim We must have a democratic constitution, that is what we fought for – #Mugabe #NewsDayZim #Mugabe says let tomorrow decide, there should be a big no to guns directing politics. We shall never again experience a time when an army is used in politics #NewsDayZim #Mugabe says congrats to whichever party wins the & let us accept that verdict, let’s pray that tomorrow brings us good news, good news to everyone is that we get our freedom back #NewsDayZim #Mugabe says when you’re put in a high place where you’re a leader, a president of the country, you have rules that guide you, you must obey the rules #NewsDayZim I say so after I had resigned, I had to go to the pension office to ask what I’m entitled to, financially the amount was $467k but people talk about $10mil #NewsDayZim I say so after I had resigned, I had to go to the pension office to ask what I’m entitled to, financially the amount was $467k but people talk about $10mil #NewsDayZim #Mugabe says today is a better day, I hope it will still be a better day tomorrow. I’m sure the good Lord will help us to bring a better day tomorrow #NewsDayZim #Mugabe says our neighbors were made to believe that all is okay, it was not a coup, you do not deploy the army. If it’s not a coup why would you do that #NewsDayZim Responding to BBC #Mugabe says I’ve not met Chamisa unless it’s Tsvangirai we were together in the GNU. I have not met him, I wish to meet him if he wins. Responding to SABC #Mugabe says it was not the army that ensured I remained in power. I was defeated at one time but Tsvangirai had no enough votes to rule. #Mugabe says I wouldn’t vote for either women because they do not seem to have much support #NewsDayZim #Mugabe says we should be free as a family and I do not support the denunciation of my wife everyday. I think those who write in the herald especially #NewsDayZim Replying to the 15Bil question #Mugabe We got nothing from the diamond companies, one was Chinese & one was Lebanese & they didn’t show us what they had got from mining #NewsDayZim Replying if he would prefer an opposition win or ED #Mugabe says he can’t vote for Zanu PF, so it’s just #CHAMISA I can’t vote for those who’ve caused me to be in this situation. Mai Mujuru & Mai Khupe have less to offer so there’s just Chamisa #NewsDayZim Replying to @nqabamatshazi #Mugabe says the army did not intervene, we lost the election & Tsvangirai did not have enough votes that why went into the GNU #NewsDayZim Replying if ZEC is captured #Mugabe says I’ve been reading in the papers & I those these are views brought up by people & I don’t think ZEC is captured #NewsDayZim Replying to the Itai Dzamara abduction #Mugabe says I’m also worried, I didn’t know who he was & if we can get info to get factual position as to what happened, who took him & where they took him #NewsDayZim Stating his view on the president #Mugabe says he’s a good worker, but it’s not always that he told me the truth so in some cases I did not believe what he told me #NewsDayZim Make sure you follow us on all social media platforms for the latest news on the upcoming Zimbabwe elections.
