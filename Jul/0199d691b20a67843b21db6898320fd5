THE late mbira queen, Chiwoniso Maraire, has continued to inspire a cross generation  of youths, including rising Afro jazz songbird Princess Makunzva (pictured), who is set to release her debut five track album, Chinonzi Rega on August 11. BY WINSTONE ANTONIO The 18-year-old singer told NewsDay Life & Style that she wants to be recognised as among veteran female artistes such as  Maraire and Hope Masike who are renowned for their mbira playing expertise. “I have been ridiculed because of the love for my culture and the mbira as well as my dread locks. Some people think I get possessed by some spirit as some people allege i get possessed, but for me it is such criticism that will certainly give me the strength to push for the growth of my career,” she said. “I know it is not going to be that easy to make it, especially as a female in this male-dominated music industry, but I will put all my effort to show that I am not a push over.” She said she would soldier on as her career was being shaped by a desire to exhibit talent and to showcase her culture rather than by motives of competition or monetary rewards. “I know am not yet there, but I believe that  with effort and determination, I will certainly perfect my mbira playing skills, which I am working hard to improve,” she said. Makunzva said former Dynamos Football Club president Kenny Mubaiwa would be the guest of honour at the launch set to be graced by several artistes across genres.
