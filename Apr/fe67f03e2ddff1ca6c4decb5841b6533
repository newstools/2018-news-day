GOSPEL musician, Wenyasha Chingono yesterday said the recording of his live DVD titled Taste of Glory this Saturday at Theatre in The Park in Harare was inspired by a desire to gauge how his music is impacting people’s lives. BY WINSTONE ANTONIO The journalist and musician’s forthcoming production follows his debut 2016 album, Mbiri Kuna Jesu, which he said was well-received on the market, with most of the songs having topped the charts on local radio stations. “We are living in an era where music followers are captivated by visuals and it is to that end that I have decided to do it in a better way through a live recording, which I can say allows for intimacy as I get to interact, with people,” he said. Chingono said he was seeking to foster a culture of unity among artistes and wanted people to catch a glimpse of what will be happening in eternity, adding this will help strengthen their devotion to God. “My desire is to see people worship God with one voice and that ambience is crucial in the gospel and it is the feel that worship music or gospel needs as it ministers directly to the soul. A live recording captures the emotions in their raw form, hence, is more authentic than the ‘doctored’ atmosphere during studio recordings,” he said. Chingono said on Taste of Glory, he will feature some top gospel artistes such as Takesure Zamar-Ncube, Janet Manyowa and Ellard Cherayi. Chingono launched his music career in 2015 with the release of a single titled Musadzokere Kumashure featuring Takesure Zamar-Ncube. He then dropped his debut album Mbiri Kuna Jesu a year later, which established him as a top gospel musician.
