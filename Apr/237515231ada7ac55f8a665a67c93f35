COMEDIAN Felistas “Mai Titi” Murata is running a competition Mai TT Challenge, as a way of giving back to the community, where a fan who imitates her best by either singing or acting, will walk away with $100 and a pair of shoes. BY TAFADZWA KACHIKO The first runner-up will pocket $50 and a T-shirt. The competition, which started last week, is running on Murata’s Facebook page, Mai T’s Diaries and will be wrapped up next Monday. “Fans have to imitate Mai Titi by singing or acting in a recorded video of less than a minute and send it to my number. I will then share it on Mai T’s Diaries Facebook page, which is my main social media platform and the one that attracts most likes will win,” she said. Mai Titi said she liked giving back and her fans deserved payback for their unwavering support. “It’s something that I usually do. I am a giver. I don’t have much, neither am I rich, but I love to give. My fans deserve it because they support me very much. I have been doing this twice a month since last year,” she said. “I also do charity work. On Christmas, I gave away 100 pairs of shoes.” Mai Titi was recently awarded the Top Female Entertainment and Social Media Enterprise Business Leader of the Year Award for championing women’s leadership roles.
