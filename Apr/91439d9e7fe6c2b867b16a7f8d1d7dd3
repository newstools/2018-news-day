ZANU PF activists in Wedza district have accused some top party officials of tampering with the party’s cell registers and deleting some prospective voters’ names ahead of the party’s primary elections set for May 5. BY JAIROS SAUNYAMA The allegations were raised during a Zanu PF provincial co-ordinating committee meeting in Marondera on Sunday, where a top provincial official claimed her name had also mysteriously vanished from the cell register. The provincial executive tasked political commissar, Hebert Shumbamhini to investigate the matter with assistance from central committee members and Senators from the province. In an interview yesterday, provincial chairperson Joel Biggie Matiza confirmed the reports and said the commissariat department would be conducting a cell verification exercise in all the nine districts before primary elections. “We have delegated the commissariat department to move into all the nine districts on a cell verification exercise,” he said.
Another district that is also experiencing similar problems is Chikomba. NewsDay is reliably informed that in Wedza South, cell registers disappeared from the party office, while other members realised that their names had been dropped. The constituency has been a problem to the party given the battle between incumbent legislator and former Transport deputy minister Michael Madanha and provincial youth league executive, Tinotenda Machakaire, who is eyeing the seat. Early this year, the provincial leadership had to move in to calm the situation, as a suspected terror group moved around the constituency intimidating party members sympathetic to Machakaire. It is reported that on Sunday after the PCC meeting, party members from Wedza met Matiza to air their grievances on the issue of cell registers. Meanwhile, the province set tomorrow as the date for submission of CVs for those interested in contesting in the party primary elections.
