FORMER How Mine coach, Bekithemba “Super” Ndlovu is rumoured to be on his way to Bulawayo City to take up the vacant post of assistant coach, with sources confiding that a deal is close, and he could be in the dugout when the local authority side hosts Black Rhinos at the weekend. BY FORTUNE MBELE Super is jobless following the disbandment of How Mine, where he had been promoted from being an assistant to the coaching position. City chairman, Jerry Sibanda admitted they are interested in Super’s services, but said they are yet to take him aboard. “There is nothing yet. We might be interested in him (Ndlovu) but we don’t have a deal as yet,” Sibanda said yesterday. The current Under-20 Young Warriors’ gaffer was previously targeted by Highlanders’ coach Madinda Ndlovu, but turned down the offer as he had been appointed How Mine coach following the departure of Kelvin Kaindu. How Mine later disengaged itself from the PSL, just a few weeks before the commencement of the current season. If he joins, as is expected, he will work under Darlington Dodo, who is currently working without an assistant after Try Ncube was redeployed to be the team’s physical trainer. Ncube doesn’t possess the requisite qualifications to work as an assistant coach. City are looking to beef up the technical bench following a slow start to the season, where they have picked four points from a possible 12.
