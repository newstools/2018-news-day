GOSPEL music outfit Masvingo Worship Choir is set to launch the three-day Masvingo Worship Festival on May 24 at an event aimed at exhibiting different ways of praying to God and uniting churchgoers through praise and worship. BY TAFADZWA KACHIKO The three-day festival will take place at Masvingo Civic Centre Garden Park. Masvingo Worship Choir director, Luke Manyamazi disclosed to Southern Eye Life & Style to various activities set to characterise the inaugural event. “There are different ways of worshiping God which some people are not aware of, so to address this ignorance we thought of introducing the Masvingo Worship Festival. This will be an annual event meant to illustrate these ways of worshiping which we hope will draw the attention of fellow gospel artistes in Africa,” he said. “As the popular adage says ‘cleanliness is next to Godliness’ we will, therefore, first embark on a clean-up campaign cleaning the Central Business District of Masvingo. The next day will have a worship seminar, worship hour when we will intercede for Africa and an all-white concert.” Manyamazi also said they were going to donate to the needy on the last day of the festival. “Lastly we will have a charity and fund day. We shall extend our generosity to the needy on the day. All proceeds will be donated to Alpha Cottages Children’s Home, Mucheke Old People’s Home and Ratidzo ZimCare Trust,” he said. “Everyone is free to come. Business people are invited to exhibit their products as partners and churches are welcomed to participate.” Guest artistes are Mpostori Wency, Pastor Josh Kays and Nyasha Mutonhori. These will be supported by Ratidzo Wekare, Welcome Nhariswa, Cladious Mubaiwa, Nyasha Tanyara, Emah “Mai” Mutisi and Admire Nago.
