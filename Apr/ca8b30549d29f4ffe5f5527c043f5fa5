Bulawayo City win 4-3 in a penalty shootout BY FORTUNE MBELE Highlanders… 0
Bulawayo City… 0 BULAWAYO City laboured to beat a second string Highlanders side, winning in a penalty shootout in an Independence celebrations tie played at White City Stadium yesterday.
City, who fielded a strong side, scored their penalties through Zephaniah Ngodzo, Justin Kaunda, Rainsome Pavari and Sipho Ndlovu, while Timothy January had his saved by goalkeeper Nedrick Madeya. For Highlanders, Andrew Mbeba, Thabo Lunga and substitute Onwell Gombami converted their kicks, while Vincent Moyo and Darlington Mukuli’s failed to beat Bulawayo City goalkeeper Wellington Muuya. Highlanders coach Madinda Ndlovu made a wholesale change to his squad for this match, picking players that have not featured this season for the Bulawayo giants, who have made an exciting start to their campaign. Some of the players on show play for the club’s developmental side. Only Adrian Silla, who will be suspended for the team’s next league match against Shabanie Mine on Sunday and striker Thabo Lunga were the only regulars who featured yesterday. Despite the changes, it was Bosso, who impressed with Ray Lunga’s dipping shot on the stroke of half time tipped over the bar by City goalkeeper, an effort that proved the only real chance of the match.
