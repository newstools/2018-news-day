Award-winning actress Marian Kunonga and filmmaker-cum-pastor Angeline Dimingo have founded the Christian Film Bootcamp, to bring together aspiring filmmakers from various churches for quarterly five-day workshops on film production. BY TAFADZWA KACHIKO The first quarter is slated for April 13 to 17. The duo has partnered  Charles Matare’s Matchmo and Mercyline Mutarisi-Nyamayaro’s Testimonies Media for equipment and other logistics. Dimingo told NewsDay Life & Style that the gesture was meant to re-invigorate the local film industry through boosting the production of religious films. “There is scarcity of locally-produced Christian or religious films, so we are bringing together 50 people with a passion for film who will train (others) to produce Christian films,” she said. “These include pastors with a passion for film and televangelism and people from the churches’ media teams. Some have already applied, but we are not at liberty to disclose names now since we have to seek permission from them.” Dimingo said production of the films is in preparation for the inaugural Christian Film Festival slated for November this year. She said the bootcamp was  “designed to give an insight on the motion picture process in taking biblical concepts into stories, shoot and edit a final product.” Dimingo said no payment was needed for one to participate at the workshops. “We will deliberate depending on the availability of resources and development from the first,” she said. Participants will be taught how to identify a good story, the use of video in storytelling and techniques of video production.
