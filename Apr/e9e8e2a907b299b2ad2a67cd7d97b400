MORE than 300 families in Chikomba Central constituency received clothing, water purification chemicals and school stationery from a Taiwan-based Buddhist Tzu Chi Foundation at the weekend. BY DESMOND CHINGARANDE Speaking at the handover ceremony at Rutanhire Clinic, Tzu Chi Foundation director Chin Chai Chu said the donation was meant to cement the strong ties between Taiwan and
Zimbabwe. “I have been in Zimbabwe for close to 23 years and I have been going around donating various items to the needy people. It’s not that Taiwan is a rich country, but the zeal to help the poor and vulnerable people is a motivation to give on its own,” Chu said. “We act quickly to serve those affected with the spirit of gratitude, respect, and love.” The foundation also donated 14 beds and 30 blankets to the clinic and some aged people in the community. More than 100 school-going children received a satchel and various stationery each. Tzu Chi volunteers also offered massaging therapy to the people who were suffering from various illnesses. Community leader Benjamin Chikerema expressed gratitude for the donation, saying it came as a relief to the people of Chikomba Central that face different challenges, which includes poor roads, electricity, communication facilities and poor living conditions.
