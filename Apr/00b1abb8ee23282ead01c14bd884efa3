Music superstar Oliver Mtukudzi has been appointed the welfare officer for the newly-formed Zimbabwe Hupenyu Hunokosha Artistes/Sportsmen Road Awareness Union that was founded to address the wellbeing of artistes, sportspersons, their supporters and families. BY TAFADZWA KACHIKO The founding president and musician Matias Kush, who was prompted to form the organisation after getting involved in an accident at Kasumbaleza (DRC — Zambia border) in 2014 and former CAPS United captain Hardlife Zvirekwi’s accident revealed Mtukudzi’s appointment as welfare officer. Mtukudzi’s appointment came against the background that he lost his son Sam in a horrific road accident in 2010. “I founded this organisation to cater for the welfare of musicians, sportsmen, their supporters and the bereaved families. Many children of the deceased musicians and sportsmen are suffering. I am a victim of a road accident and my life is not up to standard. The welfare of our Mighty Warriors is also not being looked into seriously,” he said. “Mtukudzi will join us as the welfare officer. Zvirekwi confirmed his willingness to be the vice-president and Tedious Matsito the secretary.” The launch of the organisation was scheduled for April 17, but has been moved to May 24 due to circumstances that were beyond the organisers’ control. “The launch will take place at Gwanzura Stadium. We will do a fundraising and encourage artistes, players and supporters to register. They can register through our sponsors Econet, NetOne and Telecel on their phone for just $2.” ZIMHHASRAU is also working with Clas Legal Aid Society Trust to ensure legal representation of its stakeholders. “We are inspired by this great initiative thus we are going to provide legal services to the organisation’s members with its recommendation. We hope that thousands will register “The welfare of people like comedian Bhonzo and the late Paul Matavire’s mother is not up to standard,” said Clas operations director Robson Musarafu.
