THE MDC-T says it has completed its aspiring candidates’ vetting process, with the names soon to be presented to the membership for selection during primary elections. BY OBEY MANAYITI Acting party chairperson Morgen Komichi said the vetting exercise involved checking if the candidates had served the requisite time in the party, had no criminal record and possessed the integrity required of a public official, among others. MDC-T national youth leader Happymore Chidziva said the youth assembly managed to get almost 20 parliamentary seats and a sizeable number of council seats. He, however, said in provinces like Manicaland, they failed to get what they had hoped for, adding that they would support youth candidates in party primaries. “We are happy that we managed to get the majority of constituencies that we were earmarking, but we could have done better in provinces like Manicaland. Unfortunately, we didn’t get what we were expecting, especially in Chipinge South and West. We will be going there to campaign for the youths on primary elections,” Chidziva said. Komichi said before going for primaries, they would seek consensus, but if it fails, then the party membership will have to decide. “The election directorate is mandated to receive curriculum vitaes for aspiring candidates and the job was very meticulous and overwhelming CVs were there,” he said. “On average, we received five members vying for a single constituency and more for councillors. We were checking if they meet the criteria according to our template and supported by the constitution of the party. “The directorate finished its mandate and our next stage is the selection process. We will give the people their aspiring candidates and the membership will select their preferred candidate. We are going to start the process very soon, but before that, the report is coming to the national council for approval, then primaries,” he said.
