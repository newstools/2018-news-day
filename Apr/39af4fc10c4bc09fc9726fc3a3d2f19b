ZIMBABWEAN football was yesterday robbed of one of its loyal servants after Douglas Tanyanyiwa, a businessman who sponsored various football tournaments including bankrolling his own team – Douglas Warriors – passed away. BY TAWANDA TAFIRENYIKA Tanyanyiwa, who was a staunch Dynamos supporter, had been battling cancer for some time and passed on after he failed to recover when his leg was amputated.
 He was 64. Tanyanyiwa led Douglas Warriors to the Northern Region championship in 2009 and played in the top-flight league the following year. They were relegated that season after finishing third from the bottom. Tanyanyiwa also sponsored the Douglas Tanyanyiwa tournament in his rural home in Chikomba, with former goalkeeper Tendai Tanyanyiwa, who went on to play for Dynamos and then in South Africa being one of the products of the tournament. Tendai, who is a young brother to the deceased, described the death of Douglas as a loss to the family. Zifa yesterday sent a condolence message to the Tanyanyiwa family. Zifa spokesperson, Xolisani Gwesela said: “We are deeply saddened by Tanyanyiwa’s death, our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends in this difficult period of grief. “Tanyanyiwa’s passion for football development was inspirational, not many individuals can channel their hard-earned cash towards sponsorship of football clubs, but he did, that is how special he was. “We greatly cherish the deceased’s immense emotional and financial investment in local football for so many years. “As we pay our last respects to a champion of football development, we can only celebrate all his good deeds and his lasting legacy.” Douglas is survived by his wife and four children. He will be buried in Chikomba, Njanja tomorrow. Mourners are gathered at No 15 Skymaster Road, Ridgeview, Belvedere.
