AFTER years of releasing singles, fashion designer and gospel jazz artiste, Samerah Hannah has taken her music career a step further by dropping an eight track compilation album titled Dairai. BY WINSTONE ANTONIO Hannah told NewsDay Life & Style that the compilation album was a mixture of both new and old tracks. “There is a gap between the songs I released last year and the ones I released this year. I wanted to hear the difference and have realised that there is a lot of spiritual growth and maturity that took place, so I compiled the music together to really hear the difference and also let people hear it to. Those who have been following my music can certainly hear it,” she said. “I have always wanted to do a compilation album, but the timing was not right. When I got the chance to do it I then maximised the opportunity and came up with Dairai. Most of my songs reflect prayer from Ndinogamuchira, to Dairai and even Search Me, so the core message behind my music is God listens.” Hannah, who draws her inspiration from United States-based musician, Todd Dulaney, believes the compilation album that is on SoundCloud will be available on all digital platforms and will propel her to dizzy heights. Songs on the compilation are Nyasha featuring Tatenda Ben, Dairai featuring D-Kameya, I Couldn’t Run Away featuring King Kias, Ndamirirwa Izwi, Shumba yaJudah, Yes You Are, Search Me, Ndinogamchira featuring D-Kameya and Presely Meck.
