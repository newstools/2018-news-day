BY MTHANDAZO NYONI LIZ board chairman, Cornelio Sunduza said the state of leather industry in Zimbabwe required the provision of customised composite capital injection, hence, the need for the financial services sector to have an appreciation of the basic operations and production processes of the sector. “The objective of the workshop is to develop an appreciation of the leather industry, its various production and costing process then carry out an orientation exercise to financial service providers and decision makers working with the leather industry,” he said. “This is necessary for them to be conversant with the terminologies and various processes of production resulting in them being able to design and provide tailor made products for the growth of the industry.” Sunduza said they hoped to have in place a negotiate facility for the retooling, revamping  and resuscitating of the sector and look forward to the  launching of production within specific timelines from the day of the workshop. The workshop, the first of its kind, brings together all stakeholders in the industry under one canopy to spearhead the retooling, revamping, re-launching and revival of the once vibrant leather industry in Zimbabwe in line with the government’s industrial development and special economic zones policy.
