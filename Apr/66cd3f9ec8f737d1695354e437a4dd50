SOUTH Africa-based dancehall artiste Edson Chidiya, known in music circles as Captain Golosah, who had been struggling to produce an album since joining the music industry in 2007, has finally realised his dream with the release of a 12-track album Akandigadzira. BY LIFE & STYLE REPORTER The album features South Africa-based Nigerian, Okeke Onyedika, who goes by the moniker Goonzy. Chidiya recorded his first track, Tofara, at X Facta in 2009 and did several  titled singles while in South Africa. He said recording his debut album was  his greatest achievement so far. “This is my first album after a long walk in the music road as which I started in 2007. It features a young and passionate Nigerian artiste, Goonzy, on songs I Wanna Marry You and Life No Easy,” he said. “I regard this album as my greatest achievement ever and I hope that it’s teachings will transform listeners.” Chidiya said he was moved to do the title-track Akandigadzira by how God has helped him through tough life experiences. “The motivation to do the title song Akandigadzira came from my life experience. Although life hasn’t been easy, I am here because of God’s grace. He made me who I am today and I am so proud,” he said. “Coming from a less privileged family, I never stopped dreaming big.” Other songs are Ndingaite Sei, Special Somebody, Usatya, Mwanangu, Push Push, Musummer, My Success, Padhuze Newe featuring Crissy, Black and Proud featuring Ras Spencer.
The album was recorded at Essential Music Records.
