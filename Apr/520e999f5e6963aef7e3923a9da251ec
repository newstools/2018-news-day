Castle Lager yesterday unveiled sponsorship for 10 Zimbabwean soccer fans to attend the Fifa World Cup finals in Moscow, Russia, this July. BY GARISH PHIRI The lucky fans will have an all-expenses paid trip to attend the global showcase. Delta’s national sales executive Stanley Muchenje made the announcement at the launch of the promotion that was held in Harare yesterday. “There is a package that offers two all-expenses paid tickets to consumers who will win a competition we are launching today (yesterday). Consumers need to purchase limited edition Castle Lager bottles, to stand a chance to win trips in a draw to be conducted at the end of May 2018,” he said. The Castle Football World Cup promotion will include the largest 5-aside amateur football tournament in the country as a key piece. “We are rolling out a nationwide series of community based 5-aside games that will operate on a knock-out basis, culminating into a final team emerging as Zimbabwe champions. The local Zimbabwe champions will then play against representatives of other African countries in Lusaka between the 24th and 26th of May. Should our local champions win that match, they will be on an all expenses trip to Russia for the World Cup,” Muchenje said. Local Zimbabwean soccer legend, Tinashe Nengomasha was appointed ambassador for the 5-aside games, with Cameroonian Samuel Eto’o assuming the same role at continental level. “It’s very hard to describe the experience of being in a packed stadium during a high-profile match. I am excited that fellow Zimbabweans will be getting these same experiences I have also had as a professional, if we win the 5-aside challenge on a continental level. I appreciate Castle Lager for putting together this program, and am happy to be the local Castle Lager 5-Aside ambassador,” he said.
