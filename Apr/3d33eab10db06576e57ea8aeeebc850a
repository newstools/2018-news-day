No CV was dropped and we will take them to the national headquarters tomorrow (Monday) as per procedure. The final results will be communicated soon. This does not mean people should go and campaign. The time shall come. Let us be patient and follow procedures,” he said. According to Matiza, 13 aspiring candidates submitted CVs to contest the Goromonzi South constituency while 11 others were eyeing the Mudzi North seat. Other constituencies that recorded highest numbers of CVs submitted included Maramba Pfungwe (11), Mudzi West (10), Murewa West (10),Mutoko South (9) and Chikomba East (9). Mudzi South constituency recorded the least number of CVs with only sitting legislator-cum-lawyer Jonathan Samkange battling with longtime foe Eric Navaya. Speaking at the same meeting, provincial party “godfather” Sydney Sekeramayi said every member should mobilise for massive support. “At this juncture each one of you is now a commissar, go out there and mobilise massively. We want to win with a big margin so that the opposition will not have any base to argue or contest the outcome,” he said.
