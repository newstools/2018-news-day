Debutants Nichrut have warned Yadah Stars to expect a tough battle when the two sides face off in a Castle Lager Premier Soccer league encounter at the National Sports Stadium tomorrow. BY TERRY MADYAUTA The Shurugwi-based side will be aiming for maximum points as they embark on their first trip to the capital, since gaining promotion into the topflight league. The two sides are separated by goal difference with six points apiece. They have had similar fortunes so far having managed one win, three draws and two losses. Nichrut drew against bottom of the log ZPC Kariba in their last encounter while Yadah held embattled Dynamos to a one-all draw in Harare. Nichrut coach John Nyikadzino said his side will be steely against Yadah. “Yadah are a good team which is well marshalled. They are doing well but this is our first trip to Harare and we want maximum points,” The former Chapungu coach said. “In football there are no small teams, we are just debutants but good enough and we are fighting to protect our place. We drew against ZPC Kariba last week but we played well. After losing to Highlanders the previous week coming back to earn a point was good but we can still improve against Yadah. The team is ready for Yadah Stars and we are expecting a much better performance from the team. The good thing is that we managed to pick up points on our games and we want to keep the momentum.The confidence shown by the players at training and in the matches we have played so far gives me hope that we are not going to be pushovers.”
