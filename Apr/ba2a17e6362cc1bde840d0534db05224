THE full list of the Masvingo Music Awards nominees set to be held at Charles Austin Theatre in the city on April 7 has been released, with Team Fusion — a Great Zimbabwe University band — featuring in two categories. BY OWN CORRESPONDENT Team Fusion was nominated under the Makney Logistics Best New Artiste Award and the Caravan Park Masvingo Best Jazz-Roots Artiste. Gospel Music outfit Masvingo Worship Choir (Makurira) was nominated under the Memorial Clinic Best Gospel Artiste. The late renowned musician, Leonard Dembo, is set to be honoured posthumously with a Life Time Achievement Award which was sponsored by Edson Zvobgo Jnr. Mucheke Boys will get the Upcoming Talent Award, Kinglee Promotions (Best Local Artiste Promoter), Miles Transport and Makurira Memorial (MMA Partership Award) and Liquids Bar International Best Night Life Entertainment Award. One of the organisers, Pride Masekesa, said each category has its own sponsor and thus some carry the names of those sponsors. “All the categories are company-sponsored, it was a decision we made after realising that their support needed more than just a mention. We have faced a lot of financial challenges as we were preparing for this event. Some sponsors decided to give us services instead of cash,” he said. The branded categories include the Regency Hotels Artiste of the Year, Hevoi FM Best Song of the Year, Saratoga Makausi Best Female Artiste and Miles Transport Best Hip Hop artiste. Masekesa noted that they replaced the Best Afro-Pop Artiste and Best Stage Performance Award with two new categories. “We removed Best Afro-pop artiste and Best Stage Performance and replaced with Upcoming Young Talent and Best Masvingo Peripheral Production. Best Peripheral Targets Artistes outside Masvingo town, but within the province such as Chiredzi, Zaka and Mashava,” he said.
Tickets are being sold at $10 for the VIP and $5 for ordinary people.
