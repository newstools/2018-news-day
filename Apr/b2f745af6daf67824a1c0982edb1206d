ZPC Kariba coach Godfrey Tamirepi could pay the price for his team’s slow start to the 2018 Castle Lager Premier Soccer League season with indications that the club hierarchy is getting edgy with one poor performance after another. BY SPORTS REPORTER Kauya Katuru-turu are the basement side with just two points, below Dynamos who have a point more. The Kariba-based outfit have one goal on their tally which they scored against Nichrut at the weekend. They only managed two draws against fellow strugglers Dynamos and Nichrut, a situation that has triggered fears in the club hierarchy that they could find themselves battling for survival this year, having had bigger ambitions. ZPC Kariba parted ways with veteran coach Sunday Chidzambga in the hope of luring Caps United coach Lloyd Chitembwe, whom they failed to prize away from the Green Machine.
After the Chitembwe deal flopped the club was left stranded before recruiting Tamirepi. A source within the ZPC Kariba camp told NewsDay Sport that Tamirepi’s days at ZPC Kariba are numbered if the winless streak persists. “His pedigree is already under scrutiny because ever since our team was promoted into the league, we have not experienced this kind of start,” the source said. “Of course the league is still in its infancy, but the problem is we are not even scoring goals. This disastrous start has left the club executive considering to find someone else if things don’t change soon.” ZPC Kariba have already lost four matches against Triangle, Herentals, FC Platinum (which was a wlak over since the club failed to fulfill the fixture) and Black Rhinos.
They host Chicken Inn  in their next match where they will be looking to allay the growing fears in the camp.
