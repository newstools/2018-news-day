CHIMURENGA music maestro Thomas “Mukanya” Mapfumo landed in the country on Wednesday night ahead of his one-off Welcome Back Bira at the Glamis Arena at Harare Exhibition Park on Saturday next week. BY LIFE & STYLE REPORTER Chimurenga Music Company publicist Blessing Vava expressed gratitude to the fans who thronged the Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport to welcome their icon. “A big thank you to the thousands of Zimbabweans who thronged the Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport to welcome legend Thomas “Mukanya” Mapfumo and his troops the Blacks Unlimited. It is now a reality Mukanya is in Zimbabwe after 14 years,” he said. Fans will have to part with $150 for VIP and $15 general access, while those purchasing online tickets will pay $100 and $10 respectively, although some have questioned the choice of the venue when the Harare International Conference Centre could have been ideal. Others were of the opinion that given the fact that the fiery musician has been away from Zimbabwe for many years, it would have been ideal to have a number of shows and questioned Entertainment Republic’s capacity to host a show of Mukanya’s magnitude. Mukanya, who is holed up at an undisclosed hotel, is expected to make his first official statement today. A fierce critic of former President Robert Mugabe’s government because of its unflattering human rights record and corruption, Mukanya commands a huge following in his home country. He has over the years churned out music that resonated with his countrymen at a time when pointing an accusing finger at the government was considered a treasonous act.
