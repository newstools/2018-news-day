TWO suspected notorious Zimbabwean “serial rapists”, who allegedly raped two sisters in their mother’s presence at Tlokweng village in Botswana, have been arrested and now await trial in the neighbouring country. Mmegi Progressive Ndlovu (31) and Thabelo Nfakazi Ndlovu (30) stand accused of raping women and robbing them of their valuables. Progressive has since appeared before Extension II chief magistrate Batho Kgerethwa facing two counts of rape, one count of robbery and another of entering Botswana through an ungazetted point of entry. Thabelo is facing the same charges and is reportedly admitted at Princess Marina Hospital after falling ill. The court heard that the duo and their unidentified accomplice, who is still at large, raped two women at Masetheng ward in Tlokweng on April 11 and later robbed them of money amounting to P1 900 and valuables worth P22 600. A report made to the police and investigations conducted led to the arrest of the two.
