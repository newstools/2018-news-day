BULAWAYO Metropolitan Affairs minister, Angeline Masuku, has hailed President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s administrationfor rescuing the nation from former President Robert Mugabe’s oppressive rule last November. BY SILAS NKALA Masuku made the remarks during an independence eve fund-raising dinner in the city on Tuesday. Mugabe was toppled from office after 37 years in power by the military and Parliament did a coup de grace when it initiated impeachment proceedings. “His excellence, the Commander-in-Chief of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces Comrade Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa has declared that the country has entered into a period of freedom, openness and opportunities. This is worth celebrating today. We are enjoying today in Zimbabwe.” She said history recorded a period of oppression, segregation, violence against our people, “but today we stand proud as we celebrate 38 years of independence. This is the first year in which these celebrations come in the new dispensation. In this new dispensation, his Excellency has made a call today that let us always remain united like we are here in Bulawayo.” Masuku said Bulawayo had witnessed some of the benefits of the new political dispensation, with some companies which had closed shop during Mugabe’s era, reopening for business. “We are eagerly awaiting the completion of Egodini Mall, which will be a hive of activity and provide job opportunities for our people. I want to applaud council and the people who were working at Egodini, because it was not easy for them to move out of Egodini to pave way for the project to start,” she said.
