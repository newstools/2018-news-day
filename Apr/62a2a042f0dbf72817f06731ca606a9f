THE two suspected female drug dealers arrested in Harare’s Avenues area at the weekend were yesterday granted $300 bail each and remanded to April 27. BY DESMOND CHINGARANDE Stacy Muchipisa (21) and Tatenda Muzondo (21) were not asked to plead when they briefly appeared before magistrate Tilda Mazhande charged with illegal possession of cocaine with a street value of $160. They were arrested alongside 19 other suspected drug dealers following a police raid in the Avenues area on Saturday. The State had initially opposed the bail application, arguing that the accused were a flight risk, but the duo’s lawyer Tawanda Takaendesa convinced the court that his clients had been erroneously charged for cocaine possession instead of dagga. Takaendesa’s claim was confirmed by the investigating officer who told court that the error was made by the officer who received the accused for detention. It is the State case that on April 14 this year,  detectives from CID Drugs and Narcotics Unit, stormed Mordon Place Flat at corner of Seventh and Selous Avenue and recovered three sachets of suspected cocaine from Muzondo’s handbag and a similar quantity from Muchipisa’s undergarments. Sebastian Mutizirwa appeared for the State.
