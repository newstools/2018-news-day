TOP amateur golfer David Amm and seasoned local pro Trainos Muradzikwa were recognized for their achievements after being named the Amateur Golfer of the Year and Professional Golfer of the Year respectively during the Zimbabwe Golf Association awards banquet at Royal Golf Club on Tuesday. BY FREEMAN MAKOPA The annual awards, which are aimed at recognising and celebrating accomplishments by local golfers and contributions of various individuals and stakeholders in the sport, saw more than three winners walking away with top prices. Top female junior golfer Danielle Bekker, who has been a revelation both locally and on the international scene, was also named the Lady Golfer of the Year. ZGA secretary-general Lazarus Clever said the awards were meant to encourage golfers to work hard and reach greater heights. “We have come up with this initiative as a way to encourage both junior and professional golfers that this can help improve their lives and can even earn a living through golf,” he said. “A number of Zimbabwe’s biggest sporting names were present to applaud the recipients, many of whom are volunteers, and who all support the basic objective to make the game of golf more accessible to children from all backgrounds and circumstances through junior golf programmes and ultimately the golf scholarship programme. “Various prestigious golf awards were also presentedat the ceremony which has become a fixture on the Zimbabwe golf’s diary.” ZGA’s move to host the awards ceremony comes at a time when Zimbabwean golf is improving at regional and international level. Clever also thanked the sponsors for organising the event which seeks to promote golf in the country. “Let me take this opportunity to thank all our sponsors, especially Old Mutual, who are the organisers of the event for being on our side and helping to improve the sport,” he said. “We think these events will help stimulate interest to other sponsors so that they give a helping hand.
