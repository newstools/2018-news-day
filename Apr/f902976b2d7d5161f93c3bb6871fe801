Yadah FC . . . . . 0 Herentals would be pleased with the way they have started the season so far and a point yesterday is still a good result, but this was a match they could have gone on to win had their strikers been more clinical in front of goal. In the first half they were the better side and chief striker Blessing Majairira was only denied by the framework in 19th minute. On the other hand Yadah’s veteran striker Ralph Matema had an opportunity  to give his team a goal but was denied by goalkeeper Kudakwashe Magamba. The two goalkeepers were kept busy in both halves. Herentals coach Kumbirai Mutiwekuziwa hailed his team’s boldness and courage in only their first season in the topflight. Despite his team squandering several chances the coach was more delighted with the spoils shared, “These boys are still new in the Premier League we had never been exposed to this kind of competition before but, my young stars played very well again today. Looking at how they are expressing themselves, they are showing a lot of confidence and also looking at how we were building up there is a lot of improvement now as compared to our previous games. I am very happy with the results”, he said. Yadah FC’s coach Thomas Ruzive was pleased with the result too. “Football is a game of two half’s, they dominated in the first half we dominated in the second half and we created our chances we failed to convert, they created theirs and failed to convert. So in the end it was a fair result. I am happy with the result,” he said.
