PROMINENT music promoter and wheel spinner, Simbarashe “Godfatha Templeman” Maphosa (40) has been wallowing in remand prison after he was nabbed for kidnapping a 16-year-old girl and will re-appear in court this Friday. BY DESMOND CHINGARANDE When he first appeared before Harare magistrate, Tilda Mazhande on April 13, he was remanded in custody and advised to apply for bail at the High Court.
The court heard that DJ Templeman — who co-hosts the Dancehall Remedy show on Star FM on Thursdays — held the teenager in bondage for three days without the knowledge of her parents. He was not asked to plead to kidnapping charges when he first appeared in court. The court heard that between March 29 and 31 this year in Beitbridge, DJ Templeman unlawfully detained Chido Faith Nyaguwa and deprived her freedom. The court also heard that Maphosa took the complainant to Beitbridge without the knowledge of her parents and he spent three days and three nights with her. The State alleges that the DJ exposed the complainant to situations where she would consume drugs and liquor. Linda Gadzikwa appeared for the State.
