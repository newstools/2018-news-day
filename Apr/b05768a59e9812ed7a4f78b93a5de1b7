I have committed myself to the band and I don’t want to disappoint him. “To many people, Joy Commander might be virtually a nonentity, but to me, he is a great person, who has changed my life for the better. “I helped him to record his latest album — Rudo Mukurarama — which is currently doing well on the charts.” The album Rudo Mukurarama, which is Joy Commander’s second production, was recorded by Jabulani Ndlovu at his Truetone Studios and it carries six songs — Magamba, Makorokoto, Zvinofadza Sei?, Mafaro, VaTazvida and Rudo.
