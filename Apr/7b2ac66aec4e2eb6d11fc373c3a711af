TWIN Rivers Primary School pupil Eryn Johnstone is set to rock the big screen after she landed a role in the forthcoming local psychological thriller, Mind Games set to premier in May. BY LIFE & STYLE REPORTER The psychological thriller shot in Harare last year has, however, been on a pre-release tour across the world at various festivals and scooped the best Narrative Feature Award at the Calcutta International Cult Film Festival in New York. Johnstone (11) is featured playing the role of Emmy who is stuck between her mother and father’s love as the parents have an estranged relationship following the loss of their son Josh, played by Jaeydyn Michael Armando, in a freak accident. In a statement, Johnstone said she was excited to be part of the cast in the film. “When my parents told me that Charles Mawungwa the director of the film was looking for a girl of my age to be in a film, I was so excited because it is something that I have always wanted to do,” she said. “My parents and siblings are very supportive and I know they will be excited when they finally see me in the film. I really enjoyed working with Dax Jackson, Chawabvunza, and Pamela Lewsey as they encouraged me and supported me when we were on set.” Mawungwa said the premier of the film was going to be a red carpet event and urged people to come and support local actors and film makers. It was also a finalist at the Near Nazareth Film Festival in Israel and made it as an official selection at the Five Continents International film Festival in January.
