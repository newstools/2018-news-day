MUSICIANS Jah Prayzah and Sulumani Chimbetu on Tuesday set  off Uhuru celebrations with an electric joint performance at an Independence Eve Concert that drew a bumper crowd at Odyssey Hotel in Kadoma. BY WINSTONE ANTONIO This was the first time the duo was sharing the stage after a long time following 2 Kings Entertainment’s decision to bring them together. Sulu took to the stage after Sarah Dee had done the initial rites and took fans down memory lane  as he belted some of his yesteryear hits and his father Simon “Chopper” Chimbetu’s compositions such as One Way and Gamba. His choice of songs resonated well with the Independence Day celebrations that delighted the fans who could be seen on their toes during his performance. After his top-notch performance, Sulu left the microphone for high-flying Jah Prayzah to put the icing on the cake. As usual, the Kutonga Kwaro hitmaker, backed by his Third Generation band, did not disappoint as he electrified the atmosphere with his stage performance and sing alongs such as Eriza, Goto, Kutonga Kwaro and Machembere. Although there was a glitch when sound was cut off for about 20 minutes, the fans remained calm until the party continued. 2 Kings Entertainment spokesperson Dee Nosh said the show was meant to give fans an exciting package of performances by award-winning promoters. “There have been several requests from the fans for Jah Prayzah and Sulu’s joint shows and we are just responding to our fans’ needs as our paymasters to offer what they need as well value their support,” he said. Jah Prayzah’s manager Keen Mushapaidze  said they could be more such joint shows in future. “We will continue working with our brother Sulu, which is something good for the fans and growth of our arts industry,” he said. “We are grateful that the fans responded very well by coming in their numbers and we really appreciate such support.”
