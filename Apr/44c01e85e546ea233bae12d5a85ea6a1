A SOUTH AFRICA-BASED Zimbabwean man appeared at the Harare Magistratesâ€™ Court yesterday facing aggravated indecent assault charges after he allegedly sodomised his sons, aged three and one. BY DESMOND CHINGARANDE The accused, who could not be named to protect the identity of the minors, was not asked to plead when he appeared before magistrate Tilda Mazhande, who remanded him in custody to April 27. He was represented by lawyer Bothwell Ndhlovu. The informant is his wife and mother of the two minors. Allegations are that sometime in 2016, the accused sexually abused one of the victims, who was eight months old then, while staying with him in South Africa.
His wife became inquisitive after she observed the minor had developed some bruises on his private parts, but the accused dismissed her fears, saying the injuries could have been caused by the diapers he was wearing. The matter, however, came to light on the night of November 15 last year, when the woman observed her husband pulling the minor from the bed and sexually abusing him after pulling down the diaper. When she switched on the light and confronted him over the abuse, the accused allegedly threatened to kill her. The woman reported the matter to the police the following day, but the law enforcement agents did not make a follow up. She then allegedly informed her relatives in Zimbabwe who sent her bus fare to accompany the minor children back home. On February 26, she returned to Zimbabwe together with her two children where the matter was reported to the police. The two complainants were medically examined and their medical affidavits will be produced in court as exhibits. Linda Gadzikwa appeared for the State
