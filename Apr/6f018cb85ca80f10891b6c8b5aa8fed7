DEFIANT former MDC-T deputy president Thokozani Khupe has rescheduled the date for her faction’s extraordinary congress from April 7 to 21 after it emerged that the initial date coincided with her nemesis, Nelson Chamisa’s MDC Alliance rally in Bulawayo. BY RICHARD CHIDZA In a statement yesterday, Khupe said: “All delegates, stakeholders and invited guests to the MDC-T extraordinary congress which had been scheduled for Saturday April 7, 2018 in Bulawayo, are, hereby, notified that this event has been postponed to April 21, 2018. “The postponement has been necessitated by the coming to town of the MDC Alliance rally on the same date, whose presence naturally presents a security threat to the smooth running of our programme given the violence that took place in the very recent past. We, therefore, urge our party members to go about their normal everyday business on this day.” The MDC-T split into two for the second time inside four years in the wake of founding leader, Morgan Tsvangirai’s death on Valentines’ Day this year, which triggered an acrimonious leadership battle between Khupe and Chamisa. Chamisa won the battle of wits after convincing the party’s national council into appointing him as substantive head of the MDC-T, rejecting Khupe’s call for an extraordinary congress to choose new party leadership as “required by the party constitution”. Khupe has been subjected to humiliating experiences, including assault by suspected Chamisa followers, who accused her of being a rebel after she openly defied national council resolutions and snubbed party programmes. She was fired last month alongside suspended spokesperson, Obert Gutu, organising secretary, Abednico Bhebhe, shortly after national chairman, Lovemore Moyo had resigned .
