Nichrut are looking to make good use of their home advantage when they host Caps United in a Castle Lager Premier Soccer League match at Ascot stadium tomorrow. BY TERRY MADYAUTA The topflight league debutants are buzzing following their win over Yadah in their last match, which was played in Harare at the weekend. They know, however, that the Green Machine have their tails up after winning their derby encounter against Dynamos on Sunday. “We are preparing for the game. It is just like any other game and we are targeting maximum points as always. Caps United is a good side, but we also have a strong team with a number of youngsters ready to fight for honours. It is never going to be any easy game playing against Caps United but we are playing at home and it is crucial to use home advantage,” coach John Nyikadzino said yesterday. “We won our last game against Yadah Stars and that is a morale booster and good for the players’ confidence especially when facing a team like Caps United, which comes with a lot of pressure. “The main target is to retain our position in the league, so we are fighting to pick-up points in the first half of the season,” Nyikadzino said. Nichrut’s mainstay is a strong defence marshalled by the experienced former Young Warriors captain Asani Nhongo and ex-Hwange centre-back David Boriondo. So far Nichrut have collected nine points and sit eighth on the table. Caps United have a strong attack that includes among other Denver Mukamba, John Zhuwawu and Simba Nhivi which is likely to give Nichrut a resilience test.
