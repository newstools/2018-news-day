Ngezi Platinum Stars coach Tonderai Ndiraya is looking forward to achieve what his team failed to do last season when they face off with Shabanie on Sunday. BY TERRY MADYAUTA Last season, Ngezi came out of Maglas with their tails between their legs when they were stunned 1-0 by the Chinda boys. But on the current form, Ngezi Platinum look poised to break the Maglas curse. Madamburo are unbeaten after five games and are yet to concede a goal, with 15 points at the apex of the log. Ndiraya said his side would approach their match against Shabanie Mine with caution. “We have had a very good week of preparations and a very good start to the season, winning five games on the trot which is a very good start for us as a team. I am happy with what have done, but that is already in the past, our focus now is on Shabanie,” he said. “We are playing away at a very difficult venue we went there and lost 1-0 last season. But now, we know the conditions we are going to be facing, so this week we have been preparing with that in mind. “There are different conditions as compared to any other stadium in the country and that is what makes it exciting. We are not saying the conditions are not favourable for football but they make it more interesting.” Ngezi will, however, be without Godknows Murwira, who was involved in a car accident, but they have been boasted Ghanaian Steven Owosu, who was finally given a work permit. Other giants, including reigning league champions FC Platinum, Dynamos, Caps United and Chicken Inn, failed to overcome the Chinda boys in their favourite hunting ground.
