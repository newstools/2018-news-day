THIS was supposed to be a tough battle, a contest for supremacy between two teams owned by the armed forces. BY HENRY MHARA BLACK RHINOS. . . . . . . . 0
CHAPUNGU . . . . . . . . . . . 0 But in the end, the few supporters who braved the chilly weather in the capital to witness this clash, left Rufaro Stadium a disappointed lot. There were very few chances created in a match that never reached the second gear, as the home side wasted a good opportunity to claim their third set of three points against a Chapungu side that is struggling to get its feet off the ground. The opening half hour of this match was incident free, with action restricted in midfield. The first real chance came after 31 minutes, when Edmore Muzanenhano tried his luck from a free-kick for Chapungu, but could not really trouble Rhinos goalkeeper Ashley Reyners. It proved to the only good chance the visitors fashioned in this drab affair. Rhinos created four notable chances, with two wasted by their chief marksman Lot Chiunga, who glanced a header wide on 32 minutes from a Farai Banda cross before dragging his shot on the wrong side of Talbert Shumbaâ€™s goal posts on the hour mark. Wellington Taderera did the hard part when he worked his way past Chapungu defenders moments later, but then failed to beat Shumba from a good range, in goals for Chapungu. The draw moves Rhinos three rungs up the log standings to seventh position with seven points, while Chapungu glide over Bulawayo City into 13 position with five points.
The rest of the teams are in action this weekend. Chapungu coach Tendai Chikuni was happy with the point, considering his team came into the match on the back of two successive defeats. It was the third game that Rhinos had managed to keep a clean sheet in six matches, a major positive that the club coach Herbert Maruwa picked from the game.
