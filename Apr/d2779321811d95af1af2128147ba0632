FC PLATINUM . . . . (0) 1
BULAWAYO CITY . . . . 0 BY SPORTS REPORTER Cameroonian import, Albert Eonde was on target as Champions FC Platinum edged Bulawayo City in a Castle Lager Premier Soccer League tie played at Mandava Stadium yesterday. The Cameroonian striker grabbed his first goal for the miners, thrashing a powerful strike from a Farai Madhananga cross on the half-hour mark to cap a solid performance. The platinum miners almost doubled their lead, but Ali Sadiki’s effort from just outside the box was cleared for a corner. Despite collecting maximum points, FC Platinum stand-in coach Lizwe Sweswe was happy with the result, although he expressed worry about the chances conversion rate.
“I am happy that Eonde scored his first goal for the team, which gives him confidence as a player,” he said. “We had confidence in him and it has yielded results. The most important thing is for us to win these opening games, but we need to ensure that we convert all the chances that we get. “We created many chances, but we only scored one. I think now, we are going to be working on the areas we were under-performing today. I think we have to work on the finishing.” His counterpart Darlington Dodo said defensive errors cost his side. “We played well, but we failed to defend when it mattered most and we conceded. We lost to a better side and now we are going to be focusing on our next game, hoping that we collect maximum points,” he said.
