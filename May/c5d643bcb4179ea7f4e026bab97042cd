BY GARISH PHIRI Munetsi is looking forward to playing for the Warriors and expressed his delight at having been made part of the squad that is preparing for the tournament in Harare.
 “Playing for Zimbabwe is one of the big moments in every footballers career and I am happy I am part of the team,” Munetsi said. “I am looking forward to playing at the Cosafa tournament and I am confident we can go out there and win it again. We have a strong squad, we have been working hard, creating some chances and scoring good goals. On a personal level, I think I have been doing well in the roles that I would have been assigned. We just have to put 200% effort in what we do as we hope to win it back to back.” Zimbabwe will be looking to defend the title that they won last year, but this time the technical team is using this tournament to sort out a team that will take part in the Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers in September.

I am humbled; I will try do my utmost best for my county,” he said. “I am confident that I will do well since I have been on fine form for my club. Hopefully, we will retain the cup,” he said.
