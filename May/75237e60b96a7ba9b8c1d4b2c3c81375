A GROUP of 35 Mozambican journalists is expected in Mutare next month as part of an exchange programme initiated by local scribes early this month. BY KENNETH NYANGANI Two weeks ago, Manicaland Provincial Affairs minister Monica Mutsvangwa facilitated Mutare-based journalists’ tour of Manica province. Zimbabwe Union of Journalists (Zuj) Manicaland executive member Oliver Karuru said the foreign journalists would be taken to the country’s various tourist attractions as part of the visit. “We are going to host 35 journalists from Mozambique, they are coming in the first week of next month. This is an exchange programme that is being spearheaded by our Provincial Affairs minister Monica Mutsvangwa,” he said. “We were treated like royals when we visited them. We were escorted from the Forbes Border Post by their police and we played a soccer match against them during the two-day visit. “We are engaging the Zimbabwe Tourism Authority so that they can facilitate a tourist attraction centre in Manicaland which we should visit.  We are hoping to visit Nyanga on their day of arrival and we will then have a dinner with them in Mutare.”
