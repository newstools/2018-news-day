Nichrut coach, John Nyikadzino has an opportunity to inflict pain on his former paymasters, when his side takes on struggling Chapungu at Ascot Stadium tomorrow. BY TERRY MADYAUTA The two sides meet for the first time in the Castle Lager Premier Soccer League in what promises to be an interesting Midlands derby. Having been at the helm of Chapungu for three seasons, Nyikadzino is aware that against the Air Force of Zimbabwe side his team faces a test. Chapungu are desperate for recovery after losing two matches on the trot against Triangle at the weekend, then against Dynamos on Wednesday. Similarly, MaShurugwi as Nichrut are fondly known, have suffered the same fate in the last two matches, with defeats to Caps United and Yadah Stars. “It is always going to be tough to play against a team I once coached, but that doesn’t write off the only aim of collecting maximum points,” Nyikadzino said. “Chapungu and Nichrut are like brothers, but this time around, we are in a derby and I can promise a good game of football. “Chapungu are a good side and they are very tough especially when playing at Ascot, but we also have a team that has been doing well though we lost our previous game, there is still hope that we can do better. “I am the one who led Chapungu to top-flight and Nichrut to I have known Chapungu for 20 years and that alone tells its own fairy-tale. “We both lost our last two encounters, which is sign that its going to be a fight to salvage the little pride we had. “But the most important thing is to continue working hard and remain focused because, in football, any lapse of concentration can cost you three points.”
