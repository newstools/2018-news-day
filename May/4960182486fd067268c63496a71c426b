RENOWNED socialites — Mbo Mahocs,  Star FM’s Pathisani Sibanda, top MC Master Eli and broadcaster Morris Touch — have been selected to host the second edition of the annual Bulawayo Arts Awards set for Saturday. BY SHARON SIBINDI Mbo Mahocs, a television host and actress based in South Africa, said she was looking forward to the event. “I am excited to be co-hosting the Bulawayo Arts Awards this year. It is a huge reward I do not take for granted. Being the only lady on the stage does not make me feel any better about myself because it could have been anyone else,” she said. “There are so many talented leading ladies in Bulawayo and Zimbabwe as a whole. It is simply God’s grace.”
Mbo Mahocs said the awards ceremony would be one of the major events she co-hosts, as she has relocated to South Africa. Meanwhile, television and radio host, Gilmore Tee, will anchor a two-hour red carpet event. “Last year, I missed the awards and when the opportunity to co-produce the red carpet event and also being an anchor host rose, I was extremely thrilled,” he said.
“It is such an honour to be part of this fast growing initiative, above all I am really excited to be working with some of the best individuals in the industry. We promise magic.” The red carpet is meant to also acknowledge those nominated and give them an opportunity to be heard and for people to put a face behind the works. As part of getting people excited, the two-hour event will also feature a fashion panel that will provide commentary on those who would have walked on the red carpet. The panel will be made up of Star FM’s Nokuthula “NOXY” Sithole, model Marcu Kumbie, fashion stylist Noelu and radio presenter Mpumelelo “LELO” Moyo.
