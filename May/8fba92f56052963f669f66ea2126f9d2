Afro-jazz songstress Diana “MaNgwenya” Samkange (pictured) was thrilled by her debut acting experience in the film, Chihombiro, which premiered at Ster Kinekor Eastgate, Harare last week. BY TAFADZWA KACHIKO Speaking to NewsDay Life & Style on the sidelines of the premier, the musician-cum-actor vowed to grow her acting career. Samkange, who plays the role Maidei in the film, said although her maiden experience was challenging, she was overjoyed to have discovered a new career path. “It was challenging, especially considering that that was my first time − reciting the scripts, listening to the director’s instructions and trying to balance music and acting,” she said. “Although it was challenging, I am happy that I made it.” Despite the discovery of an acting talent Samkange said she had no intention of quitting music. “I will never leave music. It’s is my first love no matter what. Acting will probably complement the music side or otherwise,” she said. Film director Melgin Tafirenyika said he enjoyed working with Samkange. “It was a great experience working with her. Although that was her first time to feature in a film, there is no doubt that she we will make it this industry,” he said.
Eunice Tava,  who plays Rudo, Maidei’s sister, said she easily connected with Samkange during the acting. In the film, Maidei is raped by Rudo’s husband and keeps the ordeal to herself until a time of confessions triggered by suspicion that their dog’s death had been caused by the mushroom they ate. The mushroom makes the movie end in an exciting way characterised by a series of confessions by the promiscuous couples, Rudo and Bhuru.
