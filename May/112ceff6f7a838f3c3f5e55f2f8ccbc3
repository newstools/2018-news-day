A YOUTH networking outfit, Network for Youth Movement — Rovambira Sect, has released a single titled Mumvura, which speaks to the current political situation in the country. BY ANESU MUSHAWATU The network’s co-founder, Talkmore Mapfumo, told NewsDay Life & Style that their song was meant to reflect on the plight of Zimbabweans before and after the “new dispensation” that saw Emmerson Mnangagwa rising to the presidency, following the ouster of former President Robert Mugabe in a coup in November last year. “Mumvura is a story of the cruel king, who was power hungry and ended up taking a crocodile as his goblin, but was later swallowed and dethroned by his crocodile, which became the new king,” Mapfumo said. “However, the crocodile’s rule was no different from the last cruel king and the people went to River Samicha and cried for help.” Mapfumo said the movement groomed youths from various sectors into future political leaders, musicians and academics. He said the new single was meant to spread the anti-violence message ahead of the 2018 elections. “Youths are usually used by politicians to commit political crimes and we want to stop that, because at the end of the day the consequences are on them, not the politicians and to spread the word we are currently working on having campaigns in Epworth, Mabvuku, Eastview  and Central Business District,” he said. Other songs from the movement include Vakomana Vemabhachi  released early last year that speaks of the atrocity committed against innocent Zimbabweans and political and human rights activists by the Central Intelligence Organisation during the 2008 and 2013 elections . The group was formed in 2017 and the single Mumvura has garnered more than 1 000 views on Youtube.
