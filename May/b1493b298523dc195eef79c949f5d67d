THE Zimbabwe Diabetic Association (ZDA) has come to the rescue of thousands of diabetics below 25 years by introducing a free insulin programme as a measure to curb various challenges that had arisen due to high costs of insulin and its scarcity in many pharmacies. BY VANESSA GONYE The target group is known as type 1 diabetes, which is commonly referred to as insulin-dependent diabetes and mostly affects those below 30 years. Speaking to NewsDay, ZDA administrator, Simion Jamanda said his association had partnered the International Diabetes Federation in a 15-year programme targeting children with insulin-dependent diabetes. “We have joined hands with IDF under a programme called Life For a Child, which entails that all people under the age of 25 receive diabetes medication for free and can be collected at any PSMI pharmacy,” he said. Jamanda said those outside PMSI areas can contact the association or visit its offices at number 10 Lawson Avenue in Milton Park, to make arrangements can be made to deliver their medication to the nearest hospital. “Through nearest hospitals, we will ensure that patients living far from PSMI pharmacies, especially those in the rural areas, get three months’ supply of insulin under the programme,” he said. The intervention is part of benefits of having a Zimbabwean in the international body for diabetics, John Mangwiro, who is currently president elect for IDF Africa.
