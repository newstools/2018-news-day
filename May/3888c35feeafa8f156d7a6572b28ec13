Highlanders striker Gabriel Nyoni has been ruled out of the match against ZPC Kariba on Sunday following a head injury he suffered in the midweek clash against Mutare City Rovers. BY FORTUNE MBELE Team doctor Shepherd Khumalo yesterday confirmed that Nyoni, who played as an attacking midfielder against Mutare City, will not be available for the Sunday game as he was being monitored. Khumalo also said Godfrey Makaruse was also ruled out after picking an ankle injury against Mutare City. “In the past game against Mutare City, Gabriel Nyoni had mild traumatic brain injury (concussion). That definitely rules him out from the next game. He has been complaining of a headache. He will manage to come back to the team just to train a week or so. I can’t project when  he will be back,” Khumalo said. Coach Madinda Ndlovu is worried that his team continues to lose key players. “It is unfortunate that we continue to have these setbacks from injuries. It looks like in every game we lose a player through injury. We will stand guided by our medical team on why we are getting these injuries now and again,” he said. In the absence of Nyoni, Highlanders might be boosted by the possible return of Nigel Makumbe. Central defender Tendai Ndlovu will have to go through a late fitness test to ascertain his availability for Sunday’s match. Adrian Silla has been passed fit as he was injured in the match against Ngezi Platinum Stars at the weekend. Right-back Bukhosi Ncube needs further assessment. The return of Peter Muduhwa who missed the last match due to suspension as well as Ndlovu’s availability have given Madinda a selection headache after he was impressed by Andrew Mbeba in the central defence position.
