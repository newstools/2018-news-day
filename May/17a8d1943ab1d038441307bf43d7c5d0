SOUTH Africa-based gospel sensation, Lindi Marc (pictured) is determined to bring the vibe back home during the Lindi Marc Zim Tour next month, where she will be the opening and closing act for a South African play — Faces: A Woman with Emotional Scars — to be screened at Theatre in the Park on Friday before holding a show in Chitungwiza on Saturday. BY ANESU MUSHAWATU Marc has roped in local gospel artistes such as Tatenda Mahachi, Mwenje Mathole, Live-soul  and Rixon  for her shows  courtesy of  Double Mc Productions  and Afri-remedy. Speaking through her husband and manager, Kross Marcellus Moses, Marc said her music was evangelical and aimed at bringing young people to God. “My music is evangelical because it mainly targets those outside the church, especially young people, who think gospel music and church are boring and I am here to prove to them that you can still be in church, dance and be cool,” she said. Marc — who recently released a single titled Faithfulness that topped South African gospel charts — said young people should use music and dance to praise God. Her new release is packed with a groovy sound and chapupu dance meant to entice the youth. The musician, who was recently in Zimbabwe and was appointed the international brand ambassador for a clothing line, CHOSEN, said she was looking forward to collaborating with several gospel artistes during her tour ahead of her second album to be released later this year. Marc is well-known for her debut nine-track album, Vhurai Nzira, which appealed to a wide audience due to the use of different languages such as Shona, English and Ndebele last year.
