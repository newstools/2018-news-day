SUNGURA exponent, Romeo Gasa has set up challenge for himself to fill up Chinhoyi Stadium on Africa Day this Friday, as he launches his sixth album, Code 263, in his hometown, where he cut his teeth before hitting the big time. BY WINSTONE ANTONIO This was after the Extra Valembe frontman had scooped the prestigious 2007 Chibuku Road to Fame’s top prize, which saw him recording his debut album. Gasa told NewsDay Life & Style yesterday that he was not fazed that some people have dismissed his dream, as too ambitious because he believed taking challenges head on so as to grow in  his career. “While some people have quizzed my choice of venue for the launch of my sixth album, I believe it is high time I faced such a challenge in my music career, having adopted a different approach to my music,” he said. “I have kept going as a result of supportive music promoters and my dedicated fans that have stood by me through thick and thin. As a way of showing gratitude to them, we have worked extra hard and put extra effort to give them an excellent product.” The 31-year-old musician said he has since revamped the traditional sungura beat to create new modern sound that also appeals to non-sungura fans. “I have not quit sungura. I have just revamped my sound by adding the saxophone, keyboards and female voices. I have also moved from that sound where the bass lines would dominate my music,” Gasa said. The Simbi Hombe hitmaker said he has continued to develop his own sound in a bid to escape the large shadow of sungura giant, Alick Macheso, whom he has been accused of copying for several years. The new eight-track album was produced by veteran producers Bothwell Nyamhondera and Jabulani Ndlovu and carries the tracks Mashura, Zviroto, Ndinokuda, Mr Brown, Anochema, Mbiri and Valembe Vacho.
