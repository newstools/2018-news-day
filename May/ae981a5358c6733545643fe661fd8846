Triangle coach was Taurai Mangwiro was pleased with his team’s performance despite the defeat. “We gave everything that we had and at a time when we thought we were supposed to press forward for the sucker-punch, but we had a decision going against us and with it the three points going. We were in control of the game most of the time,” he said He would not be drawn into discussing his views on the penalty decision. “I will not comment on the penalty, you guys (media) were there to see what happened. It’s not for me to talk about,” he said
