Both winners took $450 each in prize money. Wellington Varezi came second in the male category, while Caroline Mhandu came second in the women’s category. Manicaland Athletics Board chairperson, Joshua Matume said he was impressed with the attendance. “We were targeting about 500 athletes, but we exceeded the number, with more than 800 athletes turning up for today’s race. We had Wirimayi Zhuwayo and he is inspiring junior athletes,” he said. “We need to continue taping into the grassroots and we need to educate our athletes on how take care of themselves and important things like what food should they should be taking.” There was disappointment for the experienced Constance Nyasango, who failed to come and defend her title, which she won in the first two editions of the race in the female category. Athletes yesterday competed in five categories — open, junior, school, grandmasters and veterans. National Athletics Association of Zimbabwe president Tendai Tagara hailed Old Mutual for continuing to support the sport in the country. “We are very happy because Old Mutual is supporting athletes in the country. This is one of several races they are funding. We need more corporates to take a leaf from Old Mutual and support the sport,” he said.
