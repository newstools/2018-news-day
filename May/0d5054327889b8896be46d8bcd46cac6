RESERVE Bank of Zimbabwe deputy governor Jesimen Chipika last week encouraged women to become their own liberators and pursue their goals and vision.
Chipika, who was the guest of honour at Women Excel founding director Edna Mukurazhizha’s book launch on Friday, said the book would help women to fight discrimination and push for their rights. BY CALVIN MAHACHI “I am glad that the book brings the predicament of women to an end, finally as the women of Zimbabwe we can now write down our own stories to celebrate our selves and the next generation,” she said. “The book enables women in Zimbabwe to fight discrimination and stand up for their rights.” Mukurazhizha said the book, The Book of Successful Zimbabwean Women Volume 2, was a powerful tool of inspiration. She said this year’s theme was aimed at emphasising that relationships were the key to success. “Relationships are the bedrock to exposure, breaking through limitations and going further than you could do alone,” Mukurazhizha said. “The key story telling in this book is the relationship that we celebrated in the first book, the mentorship of young women by the older generation.” She said most women positively influenced their communities across different spheres of society and it was important to chronicle their stories regularly so that more women would rise up to the challenge. Entertainment at the launch was provided by trendy gospel musician, Flame B, who did not disappoint, as he electrified the venue with his trademark energetic dances while fellow artistes Janet Manyowa and Tembelami provided the worship music.
