AWARD-winning rapper, Desmond ‘Stunner’’ Chideme has collaborated with several artistes from different genres for the remix of the hit song Team Hombe.
Stunner roped in Soul Jah Love, Ninja Lipsy, Junior Brown, Cal_Vin, Seh Calaz, Noble Styles, Freeman, Andy Muridzo and Gze into the song, which was produced by Mt Zion Records. BY ANESU MUSHAWATU The Team Hombe hitmaker told NewsDay Life & Style that although it was not easy putting together the team, the end product was satisfactory. “Getting the work done on this remix was a challenge. It took a lot of patience in trying to get the whole team together and work on something this beautiful,” he said. “I am glad the idea of showing people that musicians can set their differences aside, unite and come up with something beautiful to entertain people was accomplished.”
Stunner said he chose people he started his music career with several years ago and were still in the game. One of the featured artistes, Ninja Lipsy, said working on the remix was an amazing experience. “It was not difficult for me to blend in the song because I started off my career with hip-hop and the team I was working with practically made me feel at home and it was quite an amazing experience,” she said. The producer, T Man of Mt Zion Records, said although they would have loved to work with all the artistes, they had to take a representative from each genre. Team Hombe frontman, Stunner recently won the Best Hip-Hop Artiste award at the Glam Awards held in the Midlands early this month and the remix has already garnered over 12 000 YouTube views.
