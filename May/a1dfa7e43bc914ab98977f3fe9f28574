Chicken Inn coach Joey Antipas has said the Castle lager Premier Soccer League is in a crisis of top strikers. BY TERRY MADYAUTA Antipas said that his team would have fared better with quality strikers upfront, but added that the problem is not unique to Chicken Inn. Since Norman Maroto hit 22 goals for Gunners in the league in 2010, no one has breach the 20-goal mark, with Dominic Chungwa scoring 16 last term. In 2011 Rodrick Mutuma walked away with the prestigious award after just begging 14 goals for Dynamos, while Leonard Tsipa also accounted for the same award with 11 goals in 2016. In 2012 Shabanie’s Nelson Mazivisa came close to the 20 goal mark when he scored 18 for the Chinda Boys. Former Chicken Inn striker Tendai Ndoro also scored 18 the following year. The 2015 championship winning coach was frustrated as he watched his strikers struggle in front of goal in their match against Chapungu at the weekend, which ended in a goalless draw. “We struggle to score obvious chances, it’s actually a problem that I have noticed and we really need to work on it. The lack of that cutting edge in attack for us is costly for us,” Antipas said. “There is a lot of work to be done in attack like most teams in the league, we are not the only team that is struggling in attack, other are also struggling, but maybe extra work will give birth to brilliant goal scorers” Chicken Inn have averaged just above a goal a game with 13 strikes from 11 matches while log leaders Ngezi Platinum Stars have so far scored 18. The Bulawayo-based side sit on position four on the league table with 20 points, nine less than the leaders. They draws return of five from eleven matches has negatively impacted on their title push as they have only suffered one defeat to date.
