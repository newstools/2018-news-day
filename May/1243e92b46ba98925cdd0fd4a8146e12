SUNGURA maestro Alick Macheso is traditionally known for coming up with new dances — from Borrowdale through to Razor Wire — and his team has assured his fans that the launch of his 11th album, Dzinosvika Kure, will also see the unveiling of a new dance. BY TAFADZWA KACHIKO NewsDay Life & Style caught up with Orchestra Mberikwazvo chanter, Jonasi Kasamba and he hinted that a new dance, which is yet to be named, will be unveiled during the album launch on July 8. “Our fans should look forward to a new dance. We have not named it yet, but we have started doing the choreography. By the end of next week, everything will be in place and we will have a name for it,” he said. Kasamba said the band was done with the instrumentals and was now working towards perfecting the vocals. “We have done the instrumental part and only the vocals are left. By July 8, the album will certainly be launched at the Chitungwiza Aquatic Complex. We will also be celebrating Macheso’s 50th birthday at the event, which is there on June 10 and the band’s 20th anniversary,” he said. Kasamba said the celebrations have been slated for Chitungwiza to honour Macheso’s grassroots fans who have supported him since he started his journey in the music industry. “The Chitungwiza Municipality has agreed to give us the venue and various companies are supporting us ahead of the launch,” he said.
