I lost my mentor Mdhara Bhonzo and the happy side is that on Saturday I will be having my graduation celebration. I have decided to celebrate the attainment of my masters degree with the Zimbabwe Open University in a very unique way, by hosting an exhibition,” he said. Tapfumaneyi said there has been a positive response from the companies he approached and 11 of them, including ZOU, will be exhibiting. “So far we have about 11 companies including Pumpkin Hotel, Floyd-Floyd Panel Beaters.” The comic actor first obtained three ‘O’ Levels at Glen Norah High School and got a job as a gardener at the ZBC, during which he did other subjects through correspondence until he got a full ‘O’ Level certificate with Crescent Independent College in 1989.
