LOCAL rhumba fanatics, who have been starved of their favourite brand of music, are in for a real treat when Congolese star Fally Ipupa lands in the country for his maiden Zimbabwean jaunt scheduled for the Harare International Conference Centre on May 26. BY SINDISO DUBE The Eloko Oyo hitmaker, who is coming under the banner of Genius “Ginimbi” Kadungure of G-Entertainment, will perform alongside an array of local acts including music superstar Oliver “Tuku” Mtukudzi and rising rhumba doyen Juntal. Concert organiser Ginimbi told NewsDay Life & Style that everything was now set for the show. “We are all about variety and bringing what people want to listen and dance to. That’s why we opted for Fally Ipupa after the Davido show. All is set for the show. The Congolese and his band are ready to rock Zimbabwe, and so is our team (ready) to host them,” he said. “There are many rhumba fans in Zimbabwe, be it locals or foreigners, who have been starved of the genre for a long time. This is the time to have fun and enjoy good music and dances.” Ginimbi recently successfully hosted the 30 Billion concert headlined by Davido and saw performances by Jah Prayzah, Killer T and ExQ as well as a guest appearance by South African top TV personality and model Boity. The last high-profile rhumba act to perform in Zimbabwe was Congolese Werrason, who headlined last year’s Carnival Rhumba Night hosted by Josh Wozheri, which was a huge flop. Werrason was later redeemed by the Carnival concert. Born Faustin Ipupa N’simba, the 40-year-old musician’s repertoire of skills include song writing, dancing and guitar strumming. He has also worked as a producer and done some philanthropy work.
