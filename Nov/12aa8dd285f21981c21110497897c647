FAITH Mucha’s new track, Time, is a timeless piece. BY OWN CORRESPONDENT Tapping into the traditional Zimbabwean sound of mbira and staccato guitar, Mucha went back into time to produce an authentic piece that can resonate with the young and old. The riveting bass lines of Blessing Sitotombe, who is fast becoming a household name in Zimbabwean music, and soothing guitar of Sam Siwela, conjures nostalgia of the yesteryear Chiwoniso Maraire hit album, Ancient Voices. Mucha’s undeniable vocal prowess in the mould of South African songstress Zahara and mbira queen Maraire is a joy to the ears, and one would wonder why she has only started making waves in 2018. The song Time is an acknowledgement that all and sundry are in God’s hands- a perfect song to instill hope amid tough economic conditions. Time has, within a few weeks of entry onto the Star FM Gospel Greats, reached number two. The song is part of the Higher Life Foundation Project Hope which carries songs from various artistes like Tammy Moyo, Paula Palloma, PJ Flames and Jah Prayzah. Mucha said project Hope was a break through after her short stint with Zimpraise, among other choirs. “When I heard about the project Hope, hope for the nation, I looked at what is happening in our nation and I said if the word of God is true, then a time for joy is coming. The time is going to come where we are going to celebrate. It’s a prophetic song to the nation and individuals,” she said. The former Zimpraise vocalist, who is based in Bulawayo, has over the years been involved in groups like Vocal Ex and Women of Valour.
