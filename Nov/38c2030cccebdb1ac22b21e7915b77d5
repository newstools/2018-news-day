CAPS UNITED . . . . . . (0) 1 CAPS UNITED gaffer Lloyd Chitembwe heaved a huge sigh of relief after his side edged relegated Mutare City at Vengere Stadium yesterday to stop a winless run that had stretched to six matches. BY KENNETH NYANGANI Chitembwe came into the match under immense pressure following the poor run of results that had seen the team losing four and drawing two. Fans were also beginning to call the head of the championship-winning coach, but this result will go a long way in papering the cracks. Youngster Kelvin Ndebele scored the only goal of the match in the 65th minute, and the former Aces Youth Academy player was unlucky not to get his second 10 minutes later, his shot drifting just wide. “It was a good win, we showed the right mentality, thanks to the boys. We are happy with the win, as it was a crucial moment for the team and thanks to our supporters. We will continue to fight on,” said the under-fire Chitembwe. Mutare City interim gaffer Ndega Matsika said they are already planning for life in Division One next year. Caps United showed some nerves early on and almost conceded an own goal 12 minutes into the match but goalkeeper Chris Mverechena was alert to parry away a John Zhuwawu miscued shot from a corner kick which was heading inside the post. Both teams had chances to score goals but they wasted them.
