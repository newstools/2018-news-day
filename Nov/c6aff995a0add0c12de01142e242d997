ZIMBABWE’S rising amateur golfer, Tafara Mpofu continues to dominate after clinching the Zim Match Play golf title at Warren Golf Club in Harare at the weekend. BY FREEMAN MAKOPA The 20-year-old golfer battled it out with some top amateur golfers in the country to book the top slot, with 50 points. Mpofu’s performance at Warren Hills came barely a week after he won the Platinum Classics Amateur Golf tournament held in Norton. Zimbabwe Golfers’ Association (ZGA) golf development officer, Boniface Chigorimbo, expressed satisfaction with the youngster’s performance, saying the golfer had a bright future. “Mpofu is a fighting athlete and he has a bright future ahead of him, given that the player continues to shine in every tournament he participates. Yes, he battled among the country’s top golfers and managed to outclass them all. “All the top amateur players, with the exception of Thompson Masiya, were present. Tendai  Kunaka, who had a return to golf on the previous week’s Platinum Classic, also won on his debut  knockout Matchplay tournament.” Chigorimbo said the tournament managed to attract 24 out of the expected 64, who gave an impressive show. But the  day, however, belonged to Mpofu, who gave it his all to be crowned champion of the tournament. “In the end, it was a battle of wits between the seasoned Tafara Mpofu and the ever -improving Graeme Lewis, with seasoned Shepherd Chiwaya chasing the fast-improving Promise Sumburero. “Once again, experience triumphed as Tafara Mpofu beat Graeme Lewis, and was six up with five holes remaining. It was a wonderful show of good golf by both players,” he added. Position        Name     	      Points 1	       Mpofu Tafara	       50
