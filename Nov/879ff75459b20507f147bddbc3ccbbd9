A CHINHOYI University of Technology (CUT) final year student, Tiffany Dyoko, showcased how creative design intertwines with other forms of art and the importance of preserving the environment through art in her three-day solo exhibition that closed at Delta Gallery in Harare yesterday. BY TAFADZWA KACHIKO Dyoko, a bachelor of science honours degree in creative art and industrial design student, said her exhibition, themed Stitches, was motivated by the desire to preserve the environment and so she integrated different forms of art. “This exhibition was motivated by my desire to change and improve lives at low costs as well as preserving the environment. The environmentally-friendly designs have already had an impact on people’s lives,” she said. “I came up with the theme Stitches after realising how intertwined the art and design field are. It speaks to how each arts discipline depends on the other for a complete job. In order to come up with the life-changing designs, one concept alone isn’t enough hence the aspect of incorporation.” Dyoko said her occupation demands that she works closely with engineers, fashion designers and architects. “When I designed the charcoal stove, I looked for the expertise of an engineer. I also did textile designs on fabric that can be used on curtains and cushions which required tailoring. I also did a pallet couch which requires the knowledge of a carpenter. All this shows how art disciplines depend on each other,” she said. Of the exhibited work, the wooden pallet, wine bottle vase, charcoal stove, papier mache vase and Jenjere showed her desire to preserve the environment.
She said she was happy with the turnout during her exhibition.
