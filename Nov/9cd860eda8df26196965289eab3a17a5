THE Bulawayo Motoring Club (BMC) has confirmed December 1 as the date for the annual Toyota Castrol Three-Hour endurance motoring event which has attracted drivers and bikers as far afield as England. BY SHARON SIBINDI Car drivers will compete in the three-hour endurance race with bikers battling it out in an hour race at the last motoring event of the year to be held at Bulawayo Motorsport Park, formerly Victoria Falls Road Circuit. Bulawayo’s Darren Winterboer, who competes in his F30 BMW and has won the title a record seven times, has also reportedly registered for the race. “The event will see more than 37 participants taking part. More entries are still coming in. Entries from Harare are expected in the next few days with some very quick cars coming to wrestle the trophy from Bulawayo local legend Winterboer who has won it for several years in a row,” BMC vice-chairperson Julian Van Vuuren said. “Monroe Motorsport represented by Vic Rich from South Africa will be in with a contingent of bikes and riders vying for top honours.” Vuuren ruled out fuel shortages spoiling the event saying “as far as the racing cars are concerned, the drivers normally are specific about their fuel.
Some will use what we call F gas which is fuel for aeroplanes and some drivers make up their own fuel plans. “But we have contacted all the drivers and we have told them that if they have any requirements or assistance as far as fuel and anything else they should let us know so that we can help them.”’ One of the drivers, Byron Norman said he will be driving his new Mitsubishi Evolution 4. “This year I have built another 99 in the shape of an Evo 4, so now it’s father against son or maybe we operate like F1 Mercedes and form a team with a strategy,” Norman said.
