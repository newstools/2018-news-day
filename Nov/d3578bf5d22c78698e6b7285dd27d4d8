Speaking to Newsday Life & Style, the 28-year old diva, who is doing business studies with the University of South Africa, said her main target audience were the youth who she believes are suspectible to drug abuse and other immoral activities. “Young people are the leaders of today and tomorrow. If they can know God and be rooted in the word of God, we will be able to fight crime, drugs and prostitution among other social ills. Most of the youths think that the gospel is boring and that being born again is associated with a low life. I did my music in a way that they will enjoy at the same time listening to the messages,” she said. Huvevegwa featured Malawian artiste FJ Futurist and Martin J Bless from South Africa. It was recorded at Contagious Music and Size Music in South Africa.
“I ventured into music to fulfil the calling of God upon my life, enticing non-believers to stay in faith,” she said. Huvevegwa said she is planning her return to Zimbabwe in January next year to market and promote her music. The musician released her debut album Mhinduro last year that saw her signing a three-year deal with Sheer Publishing Company. She has also shared the stage with established musicians like Kudzi Nyakudya and Kuda Mutsvene across the Limpopo.
