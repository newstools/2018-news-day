MUSICIAN Khuxman has brought back the memories of the late music legend Solomon Skhuza, with a remix to his all-time hit Banolila. BY SINDISO DUBE The remix, which was produced by Khuxman and Thabani Misile, has a dance house feel. “I did the remix because it’s one of the biggest songs in Bulawayo, where I come from. It’s a popular trend worldwide whereby yesteryear hits are re-done in a different way from the original, so as to keep the song fresh,” he said. “The original song was done soon after independence, making it resonate with all ages. The older people who were there during the time and also the younger age that is familiar with the new beat we employed here will both enjoy the song. I have always wanted to mix Zimbabwean Rhumba (sungura) and modern day dance music.” Khuxman said the remix was also a way of honouring and paying tribute to the late Skhuza. “The remix is a way of making people dance; I am not the composer of the song, so I wish for the remix to fill dance floors during the festive season. It’s also a way of paying tribute to the late legend. He laid a foundation for all of us in the music industry,” he said. “I am doing all this after I was given the green light by the Skhuza family, because they are the ones owning all the rights to the music.” Khuxman revealed that he would be glad to work with IYASA — who have also performed the song —in his new venture. “IYASA and I have always been close, even though we haven’t done much together. I will work closely with them since they have done a video for the original and also they have performed it for a long time,” he said. “It will be good to have them aswell on my own video version so that I don’t repeat what they have already done.”
