A GWANDA-BASED arts ensemble, Champions in Arts Showcasing Talents (Cast), has released a four-track album titled Stop Road Deaths to raise awareness on road safety. BY MOSES MUGUGUNYEKI The album, produced by revered Gwanda artiste Adrian Musa, features songs such as Safety which was sung by Zhezhingtons, Speed Kills (Mr PKay), Ingozi (Deep Citizens) and Road Safety (Bry). In an interview with NewsDay Life &Style, Musa said they came up with the projects following two horror bus accidents that happened in the country this month. “We have realised that as artistes we have a role to play in the country, hence the decision to come up with this project. Just recently, we had two horror accidents, one in Rusape and the other one near West Nicholson, which claimed several lives,” he said. “Our album is meant to raise awareness on road safety and urge road users, particularly drivers of public transport to refrain from speeding and follow road regulations.” Musa said they want to partner the Zimbabwe Traffic Safety Council, Zimbabwe Republic Police and Vehicle Inspection Department in road awareness campaigns. “We want to engage the Zimbabwe Traffic Safety Council and do mass productions of CDs of this album which we intend to share with all road users. Most road accidents are a result of human error and we need to get to the bottom of this. We need to stop road carnages and it begins with you and me,” he said. Musa, who is the brains behind the famous Gukurahundi play 1983: Dark Years, said the music on the album was a potpourri of house, kwaito and tribal House.
