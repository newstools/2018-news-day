Black RHINOS …… (1)1
Shabanie Mine……….0 Black Rhinos managed to get back to winning ways when they faced already relegated side Shabanie Mine in a Castle Lager Premier League match played at the National Sports Stadium yesterday. BY GARISH PHIRI The home side managed to settle early as they scored in the 12th minute through Honey Chimutimunzeve. Wonder Kapinda launched a long ball forward and goalkeeper Biggie Temera failed to clear the ball, leaving Chimutimunzeve to drill the ball into the back of the net. The army side could have won the game with a bigger margin, but Nyasha Mpofu was solid in defence for his side. Wellington Taderera failed to finish off a brilliant set up from Masimba Mambare as he shot wide. Black Rhinos coach Herbet Maruwa was delighted with the result. “It was a hard-fought win. We created a lot of chances which we failed to convert. We managed to defend our goal well. We are now aiming for the top six because the teams that are on top of us are dropping points. A win against Ngezi Platinum helped us achieve our target. We are already working towards next season,” he said. On the other hand, Shabanie Mine coach Alexio Sigion was happy with his side’s display despite the defeat. “Today’s (yesterday) was one best game we have played. The guys showed character. We just want to end the season with some good performances. At least we are managing to fulfill the fixtures and today the guys that are based in Harare met us at the ground and those who were in Zvishavane arrived a few minutes before the match and played without training,” he said.
