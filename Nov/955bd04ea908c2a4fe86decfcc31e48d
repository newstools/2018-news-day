THERE will be enough laughter to warm up a weekend that is likely to be rain-soaked when Umahlekisa Comedy Club, LOL Entertainment and Christian Artists Network join forces in the inaugural two-day comedy fiesta set for HopeCentre and The Thistle Room in Bulawayo on Friday and Saturday. BY SINDISO DUBE The festival is expected to unveil new talent in the city, according to Ntando Van Moyo of Umahlekisa. On Friday, a line up of comediennes will perform at the Divas Night show hosted by Emma Nxumalo and featuring Ms Dee, budding comedienne and TV personality Nyasha ‘Diva’ Mtamangira as well as Harare-based Magi and Thandoe at the Hope Centre. “The Divas Night is meant to challenge existing comediennes and attract aspiring ones to take up the trade. We also want women to hear stories told by their own voices at the same time commemorating the 16 days against gender violence which affects women more,” said. Before the show there will be a comedy and spoken word workshop at Multimedia box hub. The workshop is aimed at equipping aspiring performers who wish to join the arts industry. On Saturday, there will be the Gents Comedy Night which will see an all-male line up facing off  against each other at the Thistle Room at Bulawayo Centre. Performers on the night will include Ckanyiso DatGuy, awardwinning Mandla Da Comedian and Zwexy Mackena. Organisers of the fiesta will lead the Top Comedy Search outside the Thistle Room before the main event on Saturday. It will be an open air free event meant to attract more people, with participating acts parting with $5 for registration. “The aim of the comedy search is to identify new talent in Bulawayo as well as grow the number of comedians in the city to give comedy lovers a wider choice of acts instead of seeing the same old acts over and again,” Moyo said. He said the festival was meant to create a platform where all the comedy brands in Bulawayo could share space.
