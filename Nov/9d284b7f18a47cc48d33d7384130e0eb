Hospitality group Africa Albida Tourism (AAT) says it is enjoying its busiest year ever, with occupancies at its flagship property Victoria Falls Safari Lodge enjoying occupancies of over 80% over the past six months, a sign that tourists were returning to the resort town, an official has said. By Freeman Makopa “In the year to September 30, occupancy at Victoria Falls Safari Lodge, Africa Albida Tourism’s (AAT) flagship property, was 81,5%, compared to 71,7% over the same period last year, and similarly, across 10 hotels measured in the resort town, year-on-year occupancy rose from 53,6% to 58,7%,” chief executive Ross Kennedy said in a statement. “The new Victoria Falls Airport, with its geographical hub location, plus much enhanced route access and connectivity, has played a part in the growth of the destination”. The group’s flagship Victoria Falls Safari Lodge had its busiest August ever, with an occupancy rate of 88%. This came as the company upgraded some of its properties and introduced new activities. Victoria Falls Safari Club underwent a $600 000 redevelopment in March, which included the addition of a swimming pool, sundeck and gazebo as well as a fitness room. The sunset-facing glass-fronted fitness room opened in September, as part of a $150 000 redevelopment, which also included the replacement of the decking at the Victoria Falls Safari Lodge swimming pool, directly above the new fitness room. AAT operates a portfolio of products in Victoria Falls, including Victoria Falls Safari Lodge, Victoria Falls Safari Club, Victoria Falls Safari Suites, Lokuthula Lodges and The Boma – Dinner & Drum Show, as well as Ngoma Safari Lodge in Chobe, Botswana.
