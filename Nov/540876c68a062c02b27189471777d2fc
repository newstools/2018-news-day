POLICE in Bulawayo have arrested a suspected donkey-meat seller, who had allegedly stolen the beast, slaughtered it and sold the meat to unsuspecting residents. BY DUDUZILE NDLUKULWANI Bulawayo acting police spokesperson Inspector Abednego Ncube confirmed the arrest of Thulani Ncube (39) after he sold donkey-meat to residents at St. Peters in Pumula suburb, under the guise that it was beef. “Thulani Ncube stole a donkey worth two thousand dollars at St Peters and sold it to St Peters residents,” Inspector Ncube said. He was arrested last week on Thursday following a report made by the residents. One of the residents, Nonhlanhla Ndlovu, said the low price at which the meat was being sold made them suspicious. “The meat did not look like beef to me, and it was being sold at a cheaper price compared to the meat in the butcheries, hence I did not buy although others did,” she said.
