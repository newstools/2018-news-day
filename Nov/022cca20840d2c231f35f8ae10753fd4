ZIMBABWE women’s national team captain Chipo Mugeri-Tiripano has welcomed the International Cricket Council (ICC)’s decision to rename the ICC World T20 to ICC T20 World Cup, describing it as a game changer. BY FREEMAN MAKOPA She said the development was likely to attract significant investment to the sport. The ICC announced the development on Friday, meaning the next editions of the events in 2020 in Australia will be known as the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup 2020 and the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2020. Tiripano believes the rebranding will boost the growth of the sport, especially the women’s game in countries such as Zimbabwe, who will be fighting to make their maiden appearance at the global tournament. “The decision to rename the ICC Women’s World T20 to ICC Women’s T20 World Cup is a massive game-changer that will see women’s cricket benefiting immensely from the passionate, fervent and almost religious-like following that World Cup events always elicit,” she said. “We are particularly delighted about the rebranded event’s potential to attract significant investment as well as more young girls and women in Zimbabwe to the game, thanks to the huge attendances and television audiences associated with a World Cup event.” The ICC said the decision was aligned to its Global Cricket Strategy, which will be launched in early 2019, in which the shortest format will not only be used as the vehicle to globalise the game, but to also enhance its profile and ensure its status is at par with the pinnacle events of the other two formats. The ICC Board had already approved that all T20s between its members will be granted T20 status. It then introduced a regional qualification process that provides a pathway to all its 104 members with an opportunity to play and win the World Cup. The renaming of the event is also aimed at cementing the importance this event holds on the international cricket calendar and ensuring parity across all three formats of the game.
