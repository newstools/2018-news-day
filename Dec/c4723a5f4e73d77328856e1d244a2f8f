AMBITIOUS Premier Soccer League side Chicken Inn have made strides in the market ahead of the 2019 season with the capture of Ngezi Platinum Stars striker Clive Augusto and relegated Bulawayo City attacking midfielder Sipho Ndlovu. BY FORTUNE MBELE With reports abound that league runners-up Ngezi Platinum were facing a player exodus following the ill-fated season that saw them sacking head coach Tonderai Ndiraya, Chicken Inn quickly swooped in on the 24-year-old Augusto, with a number of players also said to have indicated their intention to join the 2015 champions. Ndlovu (24) had a good run for Bulawayo City who were however, demoted from the top-flight league, banging in five goals for the local authority side in their unsuccessful campaign. Chicken Inn spokesperson Tavengwa Hara yesterday confirmed that the Gamecocks had captured the two players. “We have tied down (Clive) Augusto from Ngezi and Sipho (Ndlovu) from Bulawayo City. It is our policy at Chicken Inn that we don’t sign players for less than two years,” Hara said. Chicken Inn are also working flat out to bring on board Highlanders defender Peter Muduhwa, who is also reportedly targeted by champions FC Platinum and Ngezi Platinum Stars. Their bid to lure goalkeeper Ariel Sibanda appears to have hit a brickwall after the shot stopper extended his stay at Highlanders by another two years last week. Coach Joey Antipas is on record saying next year he would be fighting for honours, and has demanded quality in the squad to achieve that feat. “We need to provide quality to be competitive. We have got our targets, but we are not at liberty to say their names now. We have to refresh the squad. I am not saying it is going to be a complete overhaul. The players that we have are playing well, but we need to refresh the squad. I believe in winning, and for me to win I need quality players,” Antipas said a few weeks ago.
