FC PLATINUM coach Norman Mapeza is confident his side will complete the job and qualify for the Caf Champions League Group stage following their away one-all draw against Congo’s AS Otoho on Sunday. BY TERRY MADYAUTA The Premier League champions will be looking to make use of home advantage when they take on AS Otoho in the second leg at the weekend, where either a nil-all draw or a win would take them to the next stage. The platinum miners had to fight back after going behind, with defender William Stima scoring for the Zvishavane-based side. In the previous round, they also played out a 1-1 draw with Madagascar’s CNaPS in Madagascar, where Farai Edwin Madhanhanga inspired their comeback after he grabbed their all-important equaliser, to gain an away goal advantage. They went on to eliminate the Malagasy side following a narrow 1-0 win at Mandava Stadium, courtesy of a Rodwell Chinyengetere goal. Given the character shown by his charges, Norman Mapeza believes the way his team has been responding after conceding first, starting with their CNaPS game, underlines the growing maturity of his side. FC Platinum will be banking on their proud home record and defensive stealth, having conceded just 14 goals in the league all season. Addressing journalists in Congo, Mapeza said they wanted to finish off Otoho in their favourite hunting ground, Mandava Stadium. “For us it’s a massive result. We have to push when they come to Zimbabwe. “We are happy with the draw, and now we have to finish off the job. We have to win for us to go to the next round. I think the advantage is on us now. “We need to be calm and maintain our discipline. We have to be smart if we want the results,” he said. FC Platinum will be looking to emulate Caps United who played in the group stage last year, where they acquitted themselves well.
