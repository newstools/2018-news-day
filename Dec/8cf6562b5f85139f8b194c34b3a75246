The mining index fell 4,04% to 208,56 points weighed down by losses in RioZim and Bindura. Towards the end of October, RioZim suspended operations at its Cam and Motor Mine, Dalny Mine and Renco Mine after running out of consumables and spare parts owing to forex challenges which affected operations.

In the case of Bindura, the nickel miner was weighed down by low production and logistical challenges in moving product out of the country. Currently, stock brokers are seeing potential gains in the retail counters in the short term as consumer spending is expected to firm up following Treasury’s timely payment of bonuses for civil servants this year.
