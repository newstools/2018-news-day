Zimbabwe . . . . . . . . (1)4
Lesotho . . . . . . . . . . 0 THE Zimbabwe national Under-20 side enhanced their chances of securing a place in the semi-finals of the Cosafa Cup tournament that is taking place in Zambia after thrashing Lesotho at the Shinde Stadium in Kitwe yesterday. BY GARISH PHIRI The Young Warriors currently top Group C with six points ahead of Angola and Lesotho who have a point each. Angola can still overtake the Young Warriors if they win their last two matches starting with their clash against Botswana today before the final Group game against Zimbabwe. The table toppers at the end of the pool matches qualify for the semis and they will be joined by the best runner-up from the three groups. Yesterday Zimbabwe, one of the regional powerhouses made a statement with the drubbing of poor Lesotho. Their first goal came through the current top goal-scorer of the campaign Triangle striker Delic Murimba, who was on target at the stroke of half time. Two minutes into the second half Harare City midfielder Tatenda Tumba doubled the lead for his side. The Young Warriors were not yet done as Junior Nyamuzihwo completed the second brace for Zimbabwe  so far at the tournament. His first goal came in the 64th minute and his second in the 90th minute. The Bekithemba Ndlovu-coached side have already shown a marked improvement from the last edition where they only managed to score one goal in the three group matches to make an early exit. Their goals tally swelled to six yesterday. Depending on today’s result between Angola, the Young Warriors can seal their place in the semis with a game to spare. Young Warriors team: Tinotenda Ali, Emmanuel Jalai, Brandon Mpofu, Leonard Jani, Tatenda Tumba, Devine Mhindiriri, Murimba (Blessing Sarupinda, 61’), Junior Nyamuzihwa, Takunda Mkunga (Tatenda Muringani, 67), Mbeba, Tinotenda Chiunye (Clive Rupiya, 61’)
