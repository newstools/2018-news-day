ZIMRE Property Investment (Zimre) has so far spent $9,2 million on its shopping mall in Victoria Falls which is now 65% complete. BY MTHANDAZO NYONI Providing above 5 000 square metres of lettable space, the $13 million Sawanga Shopping Mall consists of 23 shops, banks, concept houses, food courts, restaurants, coffee shops, a service station and curio shops. Zimre property manager, Stephen Kapfunde, told NewsDay in e-mailed responses that the mall would be operational by end of this month. “The shopping mall is approximately at 65% completion and we expect the contractor to finish off most of the brickwork and to have the balance of the roof sheets on the mall in two weeks’ time from now,” Kapfunde said. “About $9.2million has been spent on the project to date and it is scheduled for practical completion by end of December 2018,” he said. The mall is one of Zimre’s major projects while the company has also been converting its Nicoz House Bulawayo from offices to student accommodation. Kapfunde said the company has several projects lined up, including an office park development in Borrowdale; a townhouse development in Westgate, Harare; Selbourne Park in Bulawayo; an industrial park in Bluff Hill, Harare, and a residential development in Victoria Falls. “The land for all these developments has already been acquired and the projects are at different stages of implementation. Some are at design stage, some are awaiting approval,”
