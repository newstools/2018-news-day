THE Borrowdale Broke Golf and Country Club’s four-day junior golf clinic programme gets under way today. BY GARISH PHIRI The clinic will be led by professional golfers Stuart Stovould, the resident pro at the Borrowdale Brooke Golf Club, Mike Baylis and Paul Masara. About 20 students are part of the programme. The clinic has been an annual schools holidays event in the past five years. Baylis, who is part of the organising committee, highlighted that the main objective of the clinic is to produce future stars for Zimbabwe. “We have been doing this for quite some time now, approximately over five years. The main objective of this clinic is to introduce something new and introduce young children to the game. We first educate them with the basics, and when they are ready, we take them into the course” he said. “It will cover instruction in six basic golf skills areas, which include driving, fairway irons, pitching, chipping, sand traps and putting. The general instruction on stroke and technique include courtesy, etiquette, care of the course and how to use the rule book. “We usually get numbers ranging from 20 to 30, but we can accommodate more than that. We usually divide them into groups, depending with their age groups and how fast they learn. We want to produce future stars for this country through this,” he said.
