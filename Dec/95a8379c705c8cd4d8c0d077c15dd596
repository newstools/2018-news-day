Four Zimbabwe national cricket team players have positioned themselves to win places at this year’s Indian Premier League (IPL) by registering for next week’s auction. BY Sports Reporter Registration closed on Tuesday and it was reported by Indian media that five Zimbabwean players had registered, but there are only four local names on the list. Batsmen Malcolm Waller, Sikandar Raza, Solomon Mire, leg spinner Graeme Cremer have all put themselves up for selection. A total of 232 foreign players have signed up for the auction where there are also 736 Indians who will all be fighting for the available 70 slots. The IPL franchises now have until Monday to submit their shortlist of players that will make up the final auction list. Zimbabwe’s quartet will be looking to emulate Ray Price, Tatenda Taibu and Sean Ervine, who have all played at the lucrative T20 jamboree. Raza, who has played in different T20 leagues this year, will be hoping that this would be his breakthrough year, having enjoyed good form in the limited overs cricket for the national team. Cremer, who underwent surgery, will also be looking to bounce back, having also played well for the national team during the International Cricket Council World Cup qualifiers that were held in the country earlier this year. Over the years, Zimbabwean players have generally been over-looked by the IPL teams and with the challenges faced by the national team, their chances have continued to dwindle.
