More than 30 junior and senior players from around the country will converge at Harare Sports Club for this year’s edition of Select Healthcare masters’ tennis tournament. By Freeman Makopa Sponsored by Select Healthcare (Pvt) Limited, the tournament is scheduled to start tomorrow, running into the weekend. Tournament director Freeman Nyamunhokora said this year’s edition would be tough, with a number of younger players as well as veterans having confirmed their participation. “This year’s tournament will be a tough one. We are expecting former Davis Cup non-playing captain Martin Dzuwa and current non-playing captain Gwinyai Tongoona to be battling for the top prize. “We will have South Africa-based players that have confirmed their participation,” he said. United States-based player Michael Gutu will be hoping to retain his title after winning it in the last two years. The 21-year-old veteran beat Dzuwa in the finals last year to clinch the title, but this will not be an easy road with the in-form Mehluli  Sibanda also eyeing the title after displaying a good performance to win gold at the Youth Games in Botswana. Nyamunhokora said sponsors  poured in $3 500 for the tournament. “We are glad that our sponsors, Select Healthcare, have come to our aid once again and have poured in $3 500, of which the winner for the singles will walk away with $1 200 and $300 for doubles, and part  of the money will be used to award those that reach the semis. “Preparations have been going on well and our youngsters are looking good. They have been training hard, so we are calling upon the corporate community to come in their numbers to support the tournament,” Nyamunhokora added.
