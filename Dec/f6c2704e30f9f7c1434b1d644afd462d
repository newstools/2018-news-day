A 32-year-old police officer, Kumbulani Shumba, has witnessed the fulfilment of his childhood dream following the release of his debut five-track gospel album, Tinorarama Nekutenda. BY ADMIRE JAMU-MLAMBO The Hosanna Gospel Singers frontman told NewsDay Life & Style that he drew his inspiration from South Africa’s great gospel acts, Sipho Makhabane and the late Sfiso Ncwane, the former with whom he hopes to share the stage some day. “I started singing when I was very young, as it was my dream that one of these days I would release my own gospel album. I drew my inspiration from popular South African gospel musicians Sipho Makhabane and the late Sfiso Ncwane,” he said. Shumba said while he has had a passion for gospel music for many years, he drew even closer to God following a road traffic accident in 2007, which he believed he survived by grace. “In 2007, I was involved in an accident and God told me that he saved me so that many souls could come to Jesus through the gift he gave me; that is why I sing gospel. My wish is to be a giant in gospel music,” he said. Kumbulani’s five-track album carries songs including Power Mighty, Restoration, Church Ziva and He has the Power. He said he composed his songs based on his day-to-day life experiences and dreams.
