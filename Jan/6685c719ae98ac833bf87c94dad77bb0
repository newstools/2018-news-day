TWO of the several prison inmates from Bulawayo, who participated at the 2017 StarBrite competitions, made it to the grand finals held on January 19 and 20 at Fog Auditorium. BY SHARON SIBINDI Maurice Peterson from Khami Remand Prison and Lousinonh Siziba from Mlondolozi Special Institute made it to the grand finale. Peterson did the contemporary music and Siziba excelled in the poetry category. During the first day of the finals, all contestants performed a Lovemore Majaivana’s song in honour of the music legend. Zimbabwe Prisons and Correctional Services Bulawayo Metropolitan’s arts and rehab ambassador Clarence Garura told NewsDay that the competition attracted 10 000 participants before a shortlist of 30 acts, out of which the duo emerged winners. “Lousinonh faltered on the first round of the finals, where she was part of the top 15 and Peterson also faltered on the last round of the finals, where he made it to the top five,” he said. “Peterson did not disappoint as he did a rendition of the song Khala Ntandane, which he performed with passion and kept the crowd on their feet and even his 60s-attire blended well with his performance,” he said. Also dressed in the 70s styles, Siziba did not disappoint, as she recited a poem on Lovemore Majaivana and she left judges asking for more. Garura said the event served also as a rehabilitation programme, as it gave hope to the prison inmates since it shaped and made them better artistes. During the grand finale, Peterson performed a 10-minute show comprising five songs — When a Man Loves a Woman by Michael Bolton, Bank Alert by P Square, Thinking Out Loud by Ed Sheeran, Ndini Ndamubata by Jah Prayzah and his own composition. “This performance was a cut above the rest as the crowd was kept on their feet and the judges could not resist it, as they were seen joining the crowd in dance and waving. Judges had to admit that Peterson’s performance was the best for the night as he has a very rich voice,” he said.
