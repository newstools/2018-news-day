Staff Reporter Mupfumira’s attendance will mark the country’s 10th participation at the international tourism fair. Zimbabwe Tourism Authority chief executive Karikoga Kaseke said: “The platform will present an opportunity to engage various United Nations World Tourism Organisation member States to rally behind Zimbabwe as the destination seeks to regain the lost market in tourism development.” He urged local tourism operators to exhibit at the Fitur, adding that it was critical for Zimbabwe to leverage on opportunities presented by the international tourism trade exposition.
