FOLLOWING his brilliant performance at the BMW SA Open Golf Championship last week where he finished an incredible fourth, rising star Scott Vincent’s continues to impress after he made a satisfactory start at the Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship presented by EGA, which teed off at the Abu Dhabi Golf Club yesterday. Henry Mhara Making his debut at the star-studded European Tour event, the 25-year-old carded an impressive three under-par 69 to move himself into early contention for the lion’s share of the €2 507 520 purse. Beginning his campaign on the back nine, the former St John’s College student waited three holes for his first birdie at the par three fifteenth, the only gain he made in a bogey-free run before the turn. He picked another shot three holes after the turn, which he dropped immediately on the following hole, but then sank consecutive birdies from the sixth to sign off his opening day at three under. Vincent will start the second round three shots behind day one leader Englishman Tommy Fleetwood, who began his defence of the title with a flawless 66. The talented Zimbabwean is part of a group who are three under and hot on the heels of Fleetwood, which include world number 11 and four-time major winner Rory Mcllroy. He arrived in Abu Dhabi on the back of an impressive performance at the SA championships in Ekurhuleni last week to begin the year, where he finished fourth, a result that qualified him for this tournament. More so, last week’s performance also saw him soaring on the world rankings, moving from 321 to 251. Vincent is looking to continue from where he ended the year 2017, where he finished on a high note with a third-place finish at the Indonesia Masters in December.
