JOHANNESBURG — Zimbabwean striker, Michelle Katsvairo says he has nobody to blame but himself for an ill-fated stay at Kaizer Chiefs. KickOff Katsvairo joined Chiefs in July 2016 along with compatriot Edmore Chirambadare, but failed to make an impression for the Soweto football giants and was loaned to Tanzanian side Singida United this season. However, his spell in East Africa was cut short and he was handed his clearance by Amakhosi last week following a meeting with football manager, Bobby Motaung. Katsvairo is now on the lookout for a new club. “I don’t have regrets for signing with Kaizer Chiefs. I regret that I didn’t do enough to stay with the club,” Katsvairo told KickOff.com. “I feel embarrassed that I have to leave Kaizer Chiefs. I feel I didn’t do enough, but life goes on. “I want to thank Bobby Motaung and the entire Kaizer Chiefs family for allowing me a chance to play for one of the best teams in the country. “Even though my stay with Chiefs didn’t last long, I have fond memories of this club.” The Warriors international feels he has unfinished business in South Africa and is eager to regain the form he enjoyed with Chicken Inn. “I am waiting for offers. I believe I still have more to offer. I am determined to work hard and get back to my old form,” added the 27-year-old.
