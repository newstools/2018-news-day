A TURKISH organisation has launched a programme to provide boreholes to communities in parts of the country as part of efforts to deliver clean water and help address conditions causing the outbreak of cholera. OWN CORRESPONDENT Zimbabwe is on high cholera alert after some cases were reported in Chegutu, with as many as five deaths recorded so far and a number of suspected cases being monitored in the district. Turkey Diyanet Foundation (TDF) has commissioned boreholes in Marondera, Mazowe and Chinhoyi, which are set to benefit more than 60 000 people. The boreholes, financed by the Islamic Information Bureau Trust, were commissioned at the weekend by Turkey Diyanet Foundation Africa Specialist, Selgcuk Ozturk, who led a five-member delegation from Turkey and Germany. Ozturk said water was a precious resource that should be made available to all regardless of social standing. He said although the boreholes were drilled at Moslem premises, they would benefit all members of the respective communities . “These boreholes should serve everyone, Moslem, Christian or non-believers. No one should be denied access to this water. The boreholes have only been situated at these Masjid {mosques} so that they are protected from vandalism, but they are for everyone,” Ozturk said. He said the  organisation was committed to working with Zimbabweans and would be funding other projects in the not so distant future. TDF is currently offering  underprivileged but talented students from Zimbabwe  scholarships to study in Turkey and interviews will be conducted this week. Islamic Information Bureau Trust chief executive officer, Adam Yidi Wadi, said although they were an Islamic organisation, they were working with all Zimbabweans noting that their religion was anchored on love for everyone. He said they were working on plans to have more boreholes drilled at all deserving places with the help of their partners.
