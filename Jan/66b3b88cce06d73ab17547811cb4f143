MUSICIAN, Romeo Gasa said he has now developed his own sound in a bid to escape the large shadow of sungura giant, Alick Macheso, whom he had been accused of copying for many years. BY WINSTONE ANTONIO The Simbi Hombe hitmaker told NewsDay on the sidelines of his performance at Club Iridium in Harare last Friday that he had reinvented sungura to create his own modern sound. “I know a lot has been said since I ventured into music, but what I know is that I am my own man, having reinvented sungura to create an authentic, modern day sound that appeals to people of different music tastes,” he said. “Music is dynamic and I cannot be seen in this era playing the same old sungura. I have embraced female voices in my music, which is rare with sungura music.” After winning the 2007 Chibuku Road to Fame top prize, Gasa has been regarded as Macheso’s fierce competitor, particularly because of his bass guitar strumming skills. The Extra Valembe frontman said this year he had adopted a different approach to his music. “We are taking a serious approach, in fact, a different one from the way we used to do things in previous years. I believe I still have what it takes for me to bring back my glory days on the local showbiz scene,” he said. He, however, expressed disappointment with some  music promoters for their failure to uplift and promote rising talent. Gasa, who shared the stage with Baba Harare at the concert, urged musicians to support each other. Simbi Hombe, as the musician is affectionately known, has four albums to his name.
