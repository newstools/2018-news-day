BULAWAYO was brought to life on Saturday night through a vintage performance by South Africa’s top gospel musician, Lebo Sekgobela, who set ablaze a fully-packed Large City Hall with a scintillating performance. BY SHARON SIBINDI Sekgobela graced the My Zimbabwe Gospel Concert organised by Women’s Institute for Leadership Development (Wild) to encourage citizens — especially Christians — to register to vote. Local acts including Lorraine Maplanka Stot, Vocal Ex, Mai Mwamuka, Women of Valour, Dunamis Men, Conquerors, Gospel Unplugged, One Spirit, Nceku and Takesure Zamar Ncube warmed up the stage before paving way for Sekgobela. The songbird, well-known for her popular single Lion of Judah, kept fans on their feet throughout her performance. She later sampled Ncube’s hit song, Agere Pachigaro, and was joined by the latter for a vintage duet that dazzled fans. Wild chairperson, Lindile Ndebele said Bulawayo should be challenged, as it has recorded the least number of people who registered to vote and encouraged more women to register. Zimbabwe Electoral Commission commissioner, Sibongile Ndlovu expressed gratitude to those who attended the show and registered to vote during the concert. “Thank you for registering and congratulations because registering does not end with voting only, but it even goes to the delimitation time,” she said. “I am sure, if you come in such numbers, you will see the number of our constituencies will rise high. So let us go and encourage those at home to go and register in this time left.”
