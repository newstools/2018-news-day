Mutare North MP, Batsirai Pemhenayi (Zanu PF) has set his own 100-day rapid results programme  in line with President Emmerson Mnangangwa’s drive to turn around the country’s economic fortunes. BY KENNETH NYANGANI Pemhenayi claimed that he had embarked on several community empowerment projects to help vulnerable groups to be self-sustainable. Speaking to NewsDay during a football tournament he sponsored at the weekend, Pemhenayi said he had also handed over eight grinding mills, and freezit and peanut butter-making machines to several groups in the constituency as part of the empowerment initiative. “We are also targeting youth empowerment through sport, development of health centres and upgrading the standards of schools in our constituency to cope up world with standards,’’ he said “We would like to keep the maintaining of our roads, we are empowering women though poultry projects, where we are giving them chicks and they can benefit from eggs. I am going to help them with stockfeed in the initial stages of the project,’’ he said. “There have been some few individuals, who are blocking our projects, but we are going ahead. The President gave all ministries 100 days to achieve certain goals and I have set my own 100-day target where I want to be in all 18 districts dishing out projects.’’ Local war veteran, Robert Gumbo, applauded Pemhenayi’s gesture.
