We have been instructed to demand as we hereby do, damages from the wrongful death, shock and pain and suffering by our client, Mr Michael Zisengwe, the sum of $100 000. Our client instructed us that you contributed towards the burial of the deceased child, which is a noble gesture,” read part of the letter.
