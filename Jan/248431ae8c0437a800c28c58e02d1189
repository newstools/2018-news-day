ONE of urban grooves’ pioneers, Betty Makaya, yesterday said she was ready to bounce back into the limelight after having been away “making babies”. BY SHARON SIBINDI The South Africa-based songstress announced the end of her long self-imposed music sabbatical and promised her fans that she will be releasing a new single — Complicated — next month. Makaya, who is now a mother of four, said the single was a precursor to an album set to be released later in the year. “I am excited to make my come back and I have more to share. I have been making babies and I am a very proud mother of four. My kids are growing, so, now, I want to start being out there, like, travelling more and living more,” she said. “I am working on my album and I will be dropping singles. So far, I have my latest hit, Complicated, which I feel my fans will love. When I have new music, it means I have a new story to share through my voice.” Makaya said she had also been upgrading her professional profile, studying financial accounting, while working for a South African company.
She said she missed her fans and was happy that they had not forgotten about her. “I have missed my fans and I am glad they did not entirely forget me judging from the messages and comments on social media. So I am excited to say I am going to break the silence finally and I hope I will be that voice they have been missing,” she said. Makaya scooped the Best Urban Grooves Artist award at the Zimbabwe Music Awards in 2004 and became the best overall female musician of the year. She was also one of few female urban grooves musicians, who  managed to break into  the male-dominated industry. During her day, hits such as Usipo and Ndakusuwa, as well as the late Jamal’s Kurwizi — in which she was featured — received a lot of airplay from local radio stations.
