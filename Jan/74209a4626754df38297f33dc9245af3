Postal and telecommunication operators can now pay their licence fees in instalments after struggling to make once-off payments due to the harsh  economic  environment, the Postal  and Telecommunications Regulatory Authority  (Potraz) has said. BY BUSINESS REPORTER The authority’s director-general, Gift Machengete told journalists in Kadoma last week that operators had cited the harsh economic environment for their failure to pay the fees. He said legislation had been reviewed  to allow operators to pay the fees in instalments, adding that the regulator did not want to throw out the baby with the bath water. “We have a statutory instrument that allows us to negotiate  with them, to look at their financials and see whether  it’s true that they cannot pay upfront,” Machengete  said. “We then look at what they can pay and we negotiate, then they can pay in instalments.” There  has been concern  that Potraz  has not been firm enough  to whip players to pay the stipulated licence fees. A number of operators, mostly State-owned, have struggled to be up to date with licence fees. Of the three  mobile operators, only Econet Wireless has paid the full  $37,5 million fee. Machengete said the failure by operators  to pay fees in full jolted the regulator to seek authority  for the players to pay in instalments. “Initially, we were not allowing them to pay in instalments, they would pay upfront,” he said. The harsh economic  environment  has seen declining voice call revenue  compounded by the prevalence of over-the-top services  like WhatsApp. Telecommunication operators have pinned their hopes on broadband  to generate more revenue.
