JAMAICAN dancehall reggae artiste Charly Black concert organisers have cancelled the show after the artiste reportedly missed his connecting flight from Toronto to Kenya, enroute to Zimbabwe. BY WINSTONE ANTONIO The show was billed for Club 1+1 in Harare tomorrow night. One of the concert organisers Simbarashe “Dhama” Chanachimwe confirmed the developments yesterday. “As we had early announced, Charly Black was supposed to arrive tomorrow (today)  for the concert coming from Kenya, but he missed the flight and was stuck in Toronto, Canada that he even failed to travel to Kenya for his scheduled performance. This also affected us, as we tried our best to get him direct flights, but we failed which resulted in the postponement of the concert,” he said. Dhama said they had finalised all the relevant paperwork and were just waiting for the show. “Our house is in order as we had done everything we were supposed to do. We had bought the air tickets for him and his crew to fly from Kenya, but when we heard about the situation that he had failed to travel to Kenya and was still in Canada by Thursday, we tried to get alternative ways, but we failed to get flights and we were left with no choice but to postponed the gig,” he said. He said fans that had purchased tickets on the web ticketing platform could either hold on to the tickets, as plans were underway to ensure that the concert will be held at a later date or could get in touch with them for refunds. The Me Nuh Fraid hit-maker yesterday dropped a video apologising to his Zimbabwean fans for his failure to fufill the scheduled concert. Charly Black was billed to share the stage with Soul Jah Love, Dashocca, Mr. Syncleer, Shashl and Nutty O as well as wheel spinners including Judgment Yard, Raydizz Selekta Base and BodySlam Family.
