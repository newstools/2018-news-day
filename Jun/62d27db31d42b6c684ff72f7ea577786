ZIMBABWE’S leading professional tennis player, Benjamin Lock continues to fly the country’s flag high in the ongoing International Tennis Federation (ITF) Old Mutual Futures Series after cruising into the quarter-finals at Harare Sports Club yesterday. BY GARISH PHIRI Lock made light work of his American opponent, Jeremy Sonkin with a comfortable 6-1, 6- 1 and the 25-year-old rising star is happy with his form as he looks to finish the series of three tournaments on a high note. “I felt good, came out playing really good in the first three games and I have been serving well throughout these three weeks, so that has been a big plus for my game and puts my opponents under lot of pressure. Today (yesterday) was great, felt good out there. I played my normal game and it was good enough to make me win,” he said. Lock, who beat Anuraq Nenwani from India 6-2, 6-3 in the first round, will now face another Indian opponent, Anirudh Chandrasekar in the last eight. Chandrasekar, who is unseeded in the tournament posted a shock 7-6(4), 6-2 win over his fifth-seeded compatriot, Jayesh Pungliya. Lock has been enjoying a good run of form on home soil in the last three weeks, winning a singles title and two doubles titles, partnering his young brother, Courtney. Before flying to Zimbabwe, Lock, who is a key member of the Zimbabwe Davis Cup team, reached his first doubles final in the ATP Challengers Series in Mexico. “It’s been a good two months for me now; I played the ATP Challengers in Mexico before coming here, I think my game has really improved a lot. I had two Davis Cup performances this year and I am really excited of what this year holds. I will just have to keep practicing and bring the best version of me,” he said.
