HUBBARD’S Historical Tours in collaboration with Lewis Ndlovu of Drums of Peace have introduced a new flavour in the arts sector as they are set to  engage on a tour dubbed Marvellous Makokoba — the Beating Heart of Bulawayo which will showcase and market historical arts centres in the suburb. BY SHARON SIBINDI Ndlovu said the purpose of the tour, scheduled for June 23,   was to promote tourism and market Makokoba, which is the hub of arts in the city. “The purpose is to promote tourism and to market Makokoba as a tourist destination as it is the oldest township in Bulawayo. The township is rich with a history of interesting stories from the colonial era and of the development that have happened in the years,” Ndlovu told Southern Eye Life & Style. “The tour is around Makokoba. Starting from Stanley Hall now recognised as a monument by the government. We have places like Big Bhawa the biggest Beer Garden in the whole of Africa and world and we will showcase our famous Church Street in Makokoba.” He said transport will be provided from the National Gallery of Zimbabwe and they have lined up a string of activities. “Guests will be taken on a magical tour to this historic neighbourhood, visiting the bustling market, lively streets and colourful homes, with Lewis and Paul as our hosts and guides.” He said some refreshments and an interactive drumming session at Thabiso, a community centre which aims to increase educational opportunities for the youth in the area, will wrape-up the activities of the day. “The tour will cost $30 a person, including transport and refreshments, with proceeds going to Thabiso. People should start booking now as spaces are limited,” he said.
