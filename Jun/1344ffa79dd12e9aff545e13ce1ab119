BY WINSTONE ANTONIO ZOL chief executive Denny Marandure said the new product afforded their customers a wide range of entertainment variety. “KwesePlay uses a Roku box — a multi-screen device and application platform that connects via the internet and features the next generation set top box (decoder) to deliver premium content, such as Kwese TV, Netflix, Redbull TV, the NBA, TED TV and Iflix, among many others,” he said. “ZOL will offer Kwese Play to all its FTTH Fibroniks customers, irrespective of whatever Fibroniks package. Econet customers will be able to top up their data for consumption on Kwese content at $2 for 2GB, $5 for 5GB and $35 for 35GB.” Kwesé TV Zimbabwe head, Dorothy Zimuto said Kwese Play has a wide catalogue of movies and the 2018 World Cup soccer finals to be held in Russia. “Customers could download the Kwesé Iflix mobile App from the Google Play or the Apple App stores and thereafter, they can pay for any content of their choice via EcoCash or InApp for flexible subscription options of a daily pass, a three-day pass, a seven-day pass or a monthly subscription,” she said.
