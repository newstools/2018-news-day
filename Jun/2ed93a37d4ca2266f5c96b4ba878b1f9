We have injuries on Honest who could not even travel with the national team; Bukhosi was injured in the game against Harare City. We still have Thabo Lunga injured and we have Tendai Ndlovu who is still carrying a hamstring injury and is going through a strengthening process. We also have Mbongeni Ndlovu who is still nursing an ankle injury,” Dube said. McClive Phiri, Charlton Siamalonga, Peter Muduwa and Vincent are some of the available options in defence. Striker Gabriel Nyoni will also have to pass a late fitness test.
