TOP female golfer Ruth Chandaengerwa was over the moon after clinching ladies title at this year’s edition of Windhoek Lager amateur tournament held in Namibia at the weekend. By Freeman Makopa “It feels great winning the ladies title at this big tournament, especially since I won with some good scores. I am happy considering that I have worked hard for this tournament. It was not an easy win because I faced a lot of pressure from my opponents,” she said. Chandaengerwa said she now eyes under par scores in future tournaments. “This has always been my dream to come up first in such big tournaments. My target now is to record some good under-par scores and set a few course records going forward,” she said. The tournament acted as a good practice for Chandaengerwa as she eyes success at Zim ladies open golf tournament scheduled for Royal Harare golf club next month.
