Manicaland Provincial Affairs minister Monica Mutsvangwa has told the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (Zimra) to up its game in facilitating trade and travel at various ports of entry so that government can collect enough revenue to sustain the economy. BY KENNETH NYANGANI Mutsvangwa made the remarks at a Zimra stakeholders breakfast meeting in Mutare yesterday. She said it was government’s responsibility to provide appropriate and adequate infrastructure at border posts. Mutsvangwa added that she was aware of the challenges being faced at Forbes Border Post in Mutare such as congestion and delays in clearance of travellers and cargo.
…I would want to implore Zimra to execute their trade facilitation role with due diligence and efficiency, considering that the trade boom in this country hinges on the pace at which goods are cleared at our ports of entry and exit,” Mutsvangwa said urging all business people within Manicaland province and outside to pull their resources and energies together and invest in the province which should use its proximity from the port city of Beira. “I am undertaking to take up with the relevant government department to ensure that the border extension project that has been on the cards for years is resuscitated.” She said Zimra commissioner-general Faith Mazani indicated to her that smuggling was a major concern for the organisation urging the clearing agents and “all importers to make a conscious decision to shun smuggling”. “It is a legal responsibility to pay our duties in time and in full when we import goods into the country,’’ Mutsvangwa said.
