BULAWAYO gospel musician Margaret Mwamuka (52) who recorded her debut album at 51 years after facing several challenges is ecstatic after she clinched the Outstanding Gospel Act gong during the recent Roil Bulawayo Arts Award. (Roil BBA) BY SHARON SIBINDI Popularly known as Mai Mwamuka, the gospel artiste told Southern Eye Life & Style that she was challenged by ZAOGA founder, Ezekiel Guti, after he had encouraged church members to compose their own music. “I have been singing in the church and as you know in churches we borrow songs from each other which other people sing,” she said and recalled an incident in which a certain song was requested but the person who had rehearsed it had not yet arrived. So people struggled to get a song and we were doing that now, Apostle Guti said why is it that you like to sing other people’s songs? Why can’t you compose your own songs?” Mwamuka said by then she was not able to compose songs and she started desiring to do so before taking up the challenge. Mai Mwamuka said she felt she should do something after she turned 50 as she felt she no longer had much time. At church, you could hear the people say my music is good and the way you sing is good,” she said. “The DVD which had won an award is titled Highly Lifted Up and has 10 tracks,” she said. “After winning this award, I feel it is the beginning and I had gone it no some singing platforms where people were being auditioned, being chosen to sing in big events.”
