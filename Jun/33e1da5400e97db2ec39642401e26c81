WARRIORS star Khama Billiat has turned down Zamalek’s offer, with a move to Europe now more likely. BY HENRY MHARA The Egyptian giants reportedly tabled a $450 000 annual salary offer to lure the Warriors star away, but his agent Mike Ngobeni yesterday told NewsDaySport that the player, whose contract with Mamelodi Sundowns expires at the end of this month, turned down the offer. “He is not keen to switch to Zamalek, even though it’s one of the biggest teams in Africa,” Ngobeni said. Besides Zamalek, a number of clubs including some from Europe have reportedly showed interest for the hugely talented player. It has been reported that Azerbaijan champions Qarabag and Swedish side Djurgårdens IF have made inquiries and other reports from Romania yesterday suggested that the country’s biggest club Steaua Bucuresti had also joined in the race for his signature. Two of South Africa’s biggest clubs Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs are also interested and Sundowns have publicly stated their desire to retain his services, but the player has said he wants a new challenge. The 27-year-old has said he prefers a move to Europe, and is expected to make his decision today, according to Ngobeni. “Tomorrow is the day for him to decide,” Ngobeni said. Billiat, who was in the country since leading the Warriors to the Cosafa Cup glory early this month, had said he will not rush into making a decision. He felt he needed to weigh all the options that are available to him.
