YOUTHS from Plumtree recently pooled together $497 and R3 300 following the #PartyForACause initiative organised by Toundtainment which would be used to purchase materials for use at Plumtree District Hospital maternity and children’s wards. BY SHARON SIBINDI This comes after Plumtree disc jockey Dumisani Magalane — popularly known as DJ Yugoe (pictured) — held his birthday bash last weekend to fundraise for the hospital.
Toundtainnment director, Handsome Sibanda, said the event was a success. “In-kind donations such as door handles, taps, shower heads and a wheel chair were also received from well-wishers. The children’s ward is also set to be repainted with warm and friendly colours that will provide a hospitable stay, especially for children,” he said. “Children and maternity wards at the hospital are severely under-resourced, leaving patients vulnerable during the cold winter season. As part of their corporate social responsibility, the entertainment company mobilised two events held in Johannesburg and Plumtree, using entertainment as a tool for development in the community.” Sibanda said it was encouraging to see young people being socially responsible and giving back to their home town. “It has boosted my confidence that we, as Plumtree youths, are leading by example. We would like to thank all the people that supported the events in Plumtree and South Africa. What we achieved is beyond what we expected. “However, I wish to encourage local businesses to give back and support us as youth in such initiatives,” he said. He hailed the Plumtree community for supporting the event by turning up in large numbers, as well as corporates that threw their weight behind the initiative. Entertainment was provided by Plumtree DJs such as DJ Yugoe, Crazy Dee, Prince Eskhosini, Ericado and Mpho House Head.
